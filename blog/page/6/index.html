  <div class="entry-content">We&#8217;ve submitted our 4IP application for sproozi, we finally decided that no matter how many hours, days or weeks we though about it and changed it, it was just changing- not getting better. So we sat down today and spent some time with it and sent it in. 

Was it perfect? No. Was it good enough? Yes, I think so. It might not get us funding, but we can take it and build on it and send it to anyone else that will listen. 

In the plan we said that we&#8217;re going to have a functional tech demo live for 1st July - so 1st of July check it out, it should work.

  <div class="entry-content">One thing that occurred to me while I&#8217;ve been writing Sproozi is how tied to a mapping implementation I am and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been thinking of starting a project to abstract the details away so that I could swap implementations whenever I liked. 

A couple of things I wanted out of the API, the most important was to be able to do were switch from one implementation to another without loosing my markers or having to reload them. I really like that foot paths show up on the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a> maps. 

Then I came across <a href="http://mapstraction.com">mapstraction</a> - which looks very good. I&#8217;m checking it out to see if it meets my needs. I&#8217;ll let you know.

  <div class="entry-content">The great thing about the cloud is the extremely low barrier to entry. It&#8217;s very cheap to get up and running, it&#8217;s very cheap to scale and it&#8217;s very cheap to store data.  I&#8217;m still not fully convinced that from a long term perspective with thousands of nodes it&#8217;s going to be cheaper than provisioning your own servers and hosting but I&#8217;m more than happy to be convinced - saving money one way or another can&#8217;t be a bad thing. 

Long term though one thing businesses really need to be wary of is being tied to tightly to a platform. There is of course the issue of being tied to an API and not being able to choose a new provider, but this isn&#8217;t really what concerns me - we use debian AMIs on EC2 with a full opensource stack top to bottom. I&#8217;m taking about the the issue of economic lock in. The massive scale and masses of data the cloud allows users to store could quickly lead a company to a very expensive decision when it chooses to or is forced into moving providers. 

Moving data in or out costs about $0.10/GB (a nice easy number to work with), let&#8217;s pretend it&#8217;s about the same for all other provider, so to shift your data from one to another is going to cost you $0.20/GB. That could quickly add up to a massive cost just to choose a new provider. 1TB will cost you over $200, 1 petabyte, which isn&#8217;t going to be an unheard of amount of data in the next few years, is going to cost over a whopping $200,000! Just to move to a new provider. That&#8217;s some kind of lock-in, probably a lot more than the cost of any new or changed APIs. Not to mention how long it&#8217;s going to take to transfer that amount of data and the fact that you&#8217;ve already paid $100,000 to get it there! 

Before anyone starts, yes I&#8217;m aware you can send Amazon a big storage device and they&#8217;ll put all your data on that and send it back to you. Then you could probably send that data to your new provider and they&#8217;d put it in the cloud for you- I won&#8217;t get into how good a solution to the problem this is, because I haven&#8217;t really thought it through nor do I have any idea what that sort of storage would cost and what sort of redundancy you&#8217;d want it to have to safely truck the thing around.

What I&#8217;m trying to get across is that an open stack you control is probably something you really want to own. And it&#8217;s probably something you want to deploy across more than one provider for redundancy and your own   piece of mind. Just imagine if your cloud provider launches a competitive service, shuts down or for whatever reason decides not to service your account anymore. 

There are mitigation strategies you can apply to this. With sproozi for example we&#8217;re holding a lot of data on the nodes so that we can work with it. A lot of this can be rebuilt and reacquired, so we don&#8217;t need to truck all our data about. Saving the list of places submitted by users and that we&#8217;ve discovered is more than enough to re-crawl everything and rebuild all the indexes. This is just one example though and we&#8217;re not saving things like images and other data critical for users, so we&#8217;re likely the exception here not the rule. 

We run only on EC2 at the moment, but when we actually start getting more data we&#8217;re going to spread it out across a few providers - just in case.

  <div class="entry-content">Sproozi generates a lot of data and when we launch we&#8217;re going to be generating a lot more. Some of it overt and displayed on the website for all to see. Some of it in a database somewhere. Things like searches, locations, session information and clicks on outbound links. Some of that information could lead back to the people that are searching for it. It&#8217;s happened <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/06/aol-proudly-releases-massive-amounts-of-user-search-data/">before</a> to other sites, even after they&#8217;d thought they took steps to protect users.

We&#8217;re also not the only ones, it&#8217;s pretty much par for the course in search and on the web. If you didn&#8217;t know it before now, rest assured that every click you make on any major website of any significance is tracked - including if they can, that you clicked it. Also know that from that data they can learn an awful lot about you, if not even who you are. 

Which brings up an obvious question which many people rightly ask - If a company is concerned at all about privacy why in the would would they keep any of this data? Well, there are a few very good reasons first and foremost for us is realted to a previous post of mine about <a href="http://andrewmccall.com/2008/11/testing-for-search-result-quality/">Testing for Search Result Quality</a>. It boils down to a very real problem testing user interaction when the results the system produces for any given input change between submissions of the same input - by design. To measure how we&#8217;re performing we need to measure the actual user behaviour as opposed to measuring what we spit back. Without collecting the data to measure how changes are improving (or worsening) user experience we&#8217;re more or less releasing code and hoping it&#8217;s better. Not exactly a professional, or analytical approach to take. 

On the other hand my privacy is important to me and it makes me uncomfortable to think about all the data I generate lying about the web. I&#8217;m not sure what makes me uncomfortable, but I also know it&#8217;s not just me. I want to be in control of what other know about me. I feel like I need to treat everyone else&#8217;s data with the same respect I want for mine.  

Let&#8217;s face it, I don&#8217;t want to keep personally identifiable data about anyone for any longer than I need to. After a while they become just a statistic anyway. So we&#8217;re looking into what to do with the data and at which points we can start to anonymise  and filter the data to remove personally identifiable information, but we&#8217;re starting the process from the beginning as opposed to the end - if we&#8217;re keeping something, I want a reason to keep it. 

Some argue that data is the most valuable thing a business has in the modern world, but we tend to take a smaller, more pragmatic, more local view - we can build up a data set for some metric we want to start measuring, but we can never rebuild trust if we lose it. Plus what value will a click stream have in 2, 3, 6 or even 12 months time? So why bother collecting what we&#8217;re not using? 

Some might ask, why bring this all up, before you&#8217;ve launched? Well partly because I&#8217;ve been thinking about it recently and partly because I think it&#8217;s important to be upfront about the data we collect, what we use it for and what we&#8217;ll do with it. I also think it&#8217;s important to show that privacy isn&#8217;t an afterthought, it&#8217;s something we considered before we ever collected any data, and something we continue to not only consider as we develop, but that we take privacy of our users very seriously.

  <div class="entry-content">Once upon a time I tried to set myself the goal of a post a day forever - it was hard and I failed almost immediately. Forever, it turns out, is a long time. Days, weeks or months later I look back and think, this was supposed to be the future; Where are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_car_%28aircraft%29" class="zem_slink" title="Flying car (aircraft)" rel="wikipedia">flying cars</a>, the robots, my posts?

So I&#8217;m going to try an experiment. I&#8217;m going to write something here every day for the whole of June. I&#8217;m going to try to avoid writing the posts all in a day and scheduling them, because that&#8217;s not writing something here everyday.

I&#8217;ve just been to <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLeeds2009">BarCamp Leeds 2009</a>, <a href="http://sproozi.com">sproozi</a> is coming along well, we&#8217;re&nbsp;re-launching&nbsp;<a href="http://goroam.net">GoRoam</a> to focus more on consulting work we do and want to get more involved with, I&#8217;m getting involved setting up some coworking, open coffees and other things to try to get more involved and&nbsp;collaborate&nbsp;more with the local entrepreneurs and the digital community in Hebden&nbsp;Bridge; so really there isn&#8217;t any excuse, I have enough to say to easily fill 30 days.

So, a post a day for the month of June - Day 1.

  <div class="entry-content">Spent this weekend at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLeeds2009">Bar Camp Leeds 2009</a>, it was great. There were some good presentations and talks and I really enjoyed getting out and talking to other people in the digital and creative industries.

I&#8217;ve been working from home now for a couple of years and it&#8217;s sometimes easy to get caught up in a routine and to forget that part of things. It&#8217;s easy, despite all the blogs and twitter messages we - or at least I, constantly read- to forget that there are people nearby doing very similar things. In the case of Hebden Bridge, quite a few.

Getting out there and meeting people has really hit home the idea that I would find a coworking space in Hebden Bridge&nbsp; immensely useful. I&#8217;ve been in touch with some of the people involved with the <a href="http://www.hebdenbridgetownhall.org.uk/">Town Hall</a> project and the whole idea for the creative quarter they&#8217;ve got planned looks great. It&#8217;s probably a couple of years off though and what interests me most isn&#8217;t the building; it&#8217;s the community, collaboration and sharing of ideas.That&#8217;s something that can start without any funding, so I&#8217;ve been wondering what can be accomplished in the meantime. &nbsp;Starting now also gives the Town Hall project the best social proof and traction for the concept possible.

So what&#8217;s next? I&#8217;m going to try and organise an <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org/">open coffee</a>, try to guage interest in making it regular, <a href="http://coworking.pbworks.com/">coworking</a> and maybe even somewhere down the line try to start our own Hebden Bridge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp" class="zem_slink" title="BarCamp" rel="wikipedia">BarCamp</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" class="zem_slink" title="Unconference" rel="wikipedia">unconference</a>, with it&#8217;s diverse make up I bet it would be something unique.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve run into a few problems with some of the web apps I&#8217;ve been building lately as I&#8217;m sure others have. The explosion of the cloud is only going to lead more and more people down the exact same path. Let me just briefly explain the architecture which will help you understand why it&#8217;s a problem.

Basically I have a site which is all too commonly static html, css, images and javascript. The magic all happens through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest" class="zem_slink" title="XMLHttpRequest" rel="wikipedia">XMLHttpRequest</a>.

Ideally what I want to be able to do is to push all this static stuff somewhere fast and as close to the user as possible. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront" class="zem_slink" title="Amazon CloudFront" rel="wikipedia">CloudFront</a> is an obvious choice, but then I get hit by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" class="zem_slink" title="Same origin policy" rel="wikipedia">same origin policy</a>. To work around the issue and because I want to publish the API for developers to use I&#8217;ve implemented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" class="zem_slink" title="JSON" rel="wikipedia">JSONP</a> callbacks.

Though I did come across the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" class="zem_slink" title="World Wide Web Consortium" rel="homepage">W3C</a> <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/access-control/%20">access control</a> work and noted that we may be close to a solution, at least for the newest browsers. That brought up a whole new question that&#8217;s been plaguing web designers and developers for years - how old does a browser need to be before you take it out back and shoot it?

Look through browser market share and my tiny sample set I&#8217;m also seeing that browsers are more or less up to date. Which is great news. There are a few IE6 hold outs showing up my visitor stats but for the most part everyone appears to be more or less up to date. Has software update actually solved the issue, probably not by I for one, welcome any progress.

So that brings us to the real question, with the vast majority of the browsers out there running at or beyond the most current release do we need to care about those that don&#8217;t? Do we even want to deal with the train wreck that is IE6 compatibility anymore?

  <div class="entry-content">My partner is mid way through her pregnancy, we&#8217;re expecting number two, so within the next year I&#8217;m going to need to find somewhere else to work. Even if we end up with two girls and they can share a room, I&#8217;m just not not sure it&#8217;s going to be practical to work from home with two young children. Even with just one I&#8217;ve been finding myself in the library more and more for the piece and quiet. Which got me to thinking about coworking and reaching out to see if there is anything in town or any interest in setting something up.

For a town of it&#8217;s size <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebden_Bridge" class="zem_slink" title="Hebden Bridge" rel="wikipedia">Hebden Bridge</a> has a great artistic and creative community and more than it&#8217;s fair share of creative professionals; creatives, technologists, artists, designers, writer, journalists and programmers like me. It&#8217;s a great family town but a lot of the houses are fairly small. Perfect it would seem for a co-working setup. 

I&#8217;ve sent some emails and posted on the <a href="http://www.hebdenbridge.co.uk/forum/index.html">HebWeb forums</a> and so far there has been enough positive feedback that I&#8217;ll pursue it some more.

I recently read the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lentczner-rhttp-00">IETF draft RFC for Reverse HTTP</a>, and it looks like a pretty simple and elegant solution to a number of problems I&#8217;ve seen, especially with the move to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" class="zem_slink" title="Cloud computing" rel="wikipedia">cloud computing</a>.

The cloud brings with it some great possibilites but with them some great challenges. Computing on demand is great, if I need more power for a computationally intensive task I can just spin up a few instances for as long as I need them and shut them down when I&#8217;m done. Great in an ideal world, but&nbsp;RPC, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_manager" class="zem_slink" title="Cluster manager" rel="wikipedia">cluster management</a> and many tasks you&#8217;d have to take to run nodes in the cloud can be troublesome.

<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" class="zem_slink" title="Hadoop" rel="homepage">Apache Hadoop</a> for example, is a great, free, opensource Map/Reduce framework but it makes assumptions based on a traditional datacenter full of real hardware that is always there view of the world. One of the biggest and most troblesome for the cloud is the fact that a master needs to be aware of the slaves before they try to connect. Implementing access controls in a secure manner for nodes connection is no small task because the whole system, from end to end is based on a custom client/server model written specifically for the task.

I&#8217;m not singling Hadoop out here, just using it as an example because it&#8217;s well known and I&#8217;m familiar with it.

Let&#8217;s take a very simple API,&nbsp;imagine there is no cluster, just one node. A client submits a job to the server, the server processes it and returns the result. Now let&#8217;s make it a little more complicated, let&#8217;s make it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" class="zem_slink" title="MapReduce" rel="wikipedia">Map/Reduce</a> job and add a few nodes to the cluster. As far as the client is concerned the same thing is happening. They&#8217;re just submitting the jo to the server and it&#8217;s handling everything else, it breaks the job down into work units, submits them to the nodes in the cluster, all the results are merged together and passed back to the client.

In order to implement this you&#8217;re going to need at least a basic client/server API between the master and each slave. You could do it using traditional HTTP but you&#8217;d run into a scalability issue, imagine you have 10,000 nodes in your cluster. The server is going to need to have 10,000 open HTTP connections and each of them is going to have to poll the server at fixed intervals just to ask &#8220;Any work boss?&#8221;, &#8220;Nope, not at the&nbsp;moment. Take 5.&#8221; Sure you could increase the interval between asking, but 10,000 nodes doing nothing for 30 seconds is almost 3 1/2 days of computing power wasted.

To get around the problem you&#8217;ve got to design your architecture to push jobs to the nodes as soon as they come in. Which means writing your own client/server architecture and your own access control&nbsp;mechanisms&nbsp;amongst&nbsp;other things. If we flipped things around though, and the slave connected to the master over HTTP and then told the master it wanted to be the server we&#8217;ve&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;exactly what we wanted. The master knowing nothing about a slave, can now interact with the slave as if it were a client and it can submit a job as soon as it comes in.

An added benefit, the master/slave API can be the same as the user/master! After all, the master would be doing almost the exact same thing on a slave as the user is doing connecting via HTTP and submitting a job. No more custom client/server and vastly&nbsp;simplified&nbsp;code.

It would be easy to make it even more robust and allow for multiple tiers of masters and sub nodes. Just add a call to the API which asks the server how many slots it has free for jobs. Useful to a user from a management perspective, but also it would allow the master to partition the work into chunks based on the cluster size and based on the number of nodes served by any particular master. This would also be useful in terms of best use of resources given network topology issues - not all nodes are in the same rack or even datacentre.

Add to this the&nbsp;simplicity&nbsp;and power of simply adding something like HTTP AUTH-DIGEST at the server end and you&#8217;ve got ready made access controls. One certificate for clients, one for slaves. Clients can submit jobs, slaves get the work and there is no real need to know of anything about a slave before the first time it connects.

Why this is better than something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol" class="zem_slink" title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol" rel="wikipedia">XMPP</a> I can hear you asking. It&#8217;s not better. Not for any real reason, and yes it has some cross over in functionality with other technologies that are already out there. In the right situations though, it gives developers the option to simply things, and that&#8217;s never a bad thing.

  <div class="entry-content">Over the last few months I&#8217;ve deal with a whole bunch of companies, as a customer. Three stand out. One awful, one iritating and one today, fantastic.
<h2><strong>Virgin Media</strong></h2>
Last year when we moved home we moved out of a cable area, generally being happy with Virgin Media though and not wanting to pay the early termination fee we opted to go with their ADSL service. Of course these things never go smoothly and we had to have the ADSL line already here terminated, a new account created when that&nbsp;happened&nbsp;and it was all going to take a few weeks.

So I cancelled my account, they told me I&#8217;d have to pay the termination fee, but that it would be refunded when our new account was opened. A few weeks later, more or less on time the ADSL line was connected and we were online. About a week later I get a nasty letter from the Virgin Medial collections department warning me to pay what I owe.

I rang them - not a free phone number might I add and after some time got to the bottom of it. They dropped the termination fee from their demand but I did have to pay a month that was still outstanding on the account. I paid that on the card, on the spot.

<strong>fail</strong> - Virgin really should have some sense and the ability to link my new account, old account and know that I&#8217;m just moving home and shouldn&#8217;t need to pay the early termination fee. The fact that I can cancel within the connection period just isn&#8217;t good enough, I shouldn&#8217;t be penalised for&nbsp;shortcomings&nbsp;in your systems. Also, what is up with needing me to pay the last month by card? What happened to the direct debit straight from my bank account which they used every other month? And all that&#8217;s before we get into the fact that I&#8217;m an existing customer and they&#8217;re sending me nasty letters. If the connection hadn&#8217;t been setup already we probably would have gone elsewhere, just because of that- having said that, they&#8217;re a decent ISP most of the time.
<h2><strong>3</strong></h2>
Last year some time I signed up with 3 for a USB data card, when I was in the store I offered a &pound;15/month skype phone contract, which would half the cost of the data card. It seemed like a good deal and I though at the very least the skype phone might be useful (it wasn&#8217;t) so I agreed. Some time later, after the 6 month contract was over I called to cancel the phone. I was on the phone for at least 30 minutes and must have told the operator on the other end at least a dozen times that I just want to cancel the contract. I said I was happy with my existing options for a backup phone and that even at &pound;5/month with a brand new phone, it just wasn&#8217;t worth it for me to continue; I said it again, and again. Eventually he put me on hold for 5 minutes &nbsp;and came back an announced my account was cancelled.

<strong>fail </strong>- The problem with someone hard selling to me when I&#8217;m trying t0 cancel the account is that I can&#8217;t just put the phone down, if I do I won&#8217;t get the account cancelled. No means no, after saying no 5 or 6 times I wasn&#8217;t likely to change my mind. If he&#8217;d looked into the account he would have seen that I hadn&#8217;t even switched the phone on in months - if he can&#8217;t see that, he should be able to.
<h2><strong>Apple</strong></h2>
Last week,&nbsp;completely&nbsp;different. My poor used and abused macbook needed some fixing. It&#8217;s over 2 1/2 years old and to be fair has travelled thousands of miles a bit of wear and tear is to be expected. The top case was a bit cracked, a somewhat common problem and the wire at the magsafe connector was a bir frayed . So I booked an appointment at the Genius Bar in the Trafford Centre this morning. Got in the car and drove an hour there. Since the power supply was out of warenty I could get it replaced under a repair and it would cost less than the retail part. Then he took a look, said that they&#8217;d replace the top case for free and book the power supply in under the same ticket so I&#8217;d get that free too. They said to drop back in an hour and it should be finished. So I left the machine with them and half an hour later they called to tell me it was fixed. 30 minutes, and my mac looks as good as new!

<strong>impressed</strong> - I honestly couldn&#8217;t be more impressed. I booked myself in online in a few minutes and since I had an appointment I was served as soon as I got in the store. It took the Genius behind the bar a few minutes to asses the problems and book the machine in. 30 minutes later they had it fixed.
