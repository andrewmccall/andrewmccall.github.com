  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://mashable.com/2009/12/07/sign-up-api/">This</a> is possibly big news, something I&#8217;ve hoped they would do for a long time and something <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/11/apis-in-the-late-afternoon.html">Fred Wilson voiced his support for</a> a few weeks ago: Creating user accounts via the twitter API.

Both the projects I&#8217;m working on full time could benefit from this. Sproozi of course because we could create user accounts for them and help users find interesting local people to follow. My oft promised side project which at it&#8217;s most basic level [the one I&#8217;ll launch first] aims to make making announcements easier could benefit by making the signup process seamless - users wouldn&#8217;t have to already have to have a twitter account, they could create it all in one step with us.

That I think is what makes this such big news, sites that rely on users already having a twitter account to do something useful will be able to create that account as a seamless on site process. That will help drive users to the sites and drive users to twitter. Let&#8217;s hope they start rolling it out to other developers!

  <div class="entry-content">I followed up with a few potential investors who&#8217;ve had my pitch for&nbsp;<a href="http://sproozi.com">Sproozi</a> today. It&#8217;s been a week or two since I heard from them and I honestly wasn&#8217;t surprised when they came back with a no. Not hearing anything doesn&#8217;t exactly show a great deal of excitement.

I&#8217;m an optimist though and on the bright side I haven&#8217;t had a conversation or a meeting that I haven&#8217;t benefited from.

With first VC I met I had a pretty friendly audience, I knew him already, and I got some really good advice about how aspects of the pitch, the business in general and some introductions. With another, less friendly, it was clear I hadn&#8217;t done my homework. In yet another I learned a bit more and took on board the suggestion that I get a core set of users together to beta test the project - that basically just launching it blind was probably not going to go anywhere.

The rest of my meetings and conversations have been just as good. In each one I&#8217;ve refined my pitch further had clearer and better prepared answers for questions&nbsp;but I think I may be making one mistake that is keeping me from getting funded- trying to0 soon.

I&#8217;m starting to think that, because I have to explain the idea. I really s to be able to just give someone a link they can click and play with. With a link and 10 minutes, countless objections can be overcome and services that sound similar dismissed - it also gives a pretty clear idea of exactly what the thing does. I can&#8217;t possibly manage that level of understanding in any pitch, no matter how long or how refined.

So what&#8217;s next? I&#8217;ve got a side project I keep hinting about that&#8217;s painfully close to ready to launch very soon and then I&#8217;m going to keep working on <a href="http://sproozi.com">Sproozi</a>, get it to the point where I can send that link, develop some feedback from users and get some interesting data - get it to the point where I&#8217;m talking about what we are doing, not what we want to do. I&#8217;m not put off, if anything I&#8217;m more focused on distilling Sproozi down to the minimum set of features I can launch with.

<em>If you haven&#8217;t already, signup for the super-secret-pre-alpha on the <a href="http://sproozi.com">Sproozi site</a> and as soon as I get there, I&#8217;ll let you know. </em>

  <div class="entry-content">I realised that I&#8217;m not very good at this when I looked at my last commit for this theme. The message was &#8220;added a few things&#8221; a message I find myself using when I have nothing else to say, or if I&#8217;ve done too much work and either can&#8217;t remember all of what I did or be bothered writing it all out.

It&#8217;s bad form though, and I&#8217;m trying to learn my way into using git properly to make it happen less. Basically I&#8217;m still trying to find the right place between a commit for a unit of work and my previous more traditional view that all commits must compile and pass tests. At the same time I&#8217;m trying to reconcile that with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" class="zem_slink" title="Kanban" rel="wikipedia">Kanban</a> board way of organising what to do.

How does everyone else commit? When, how often and what &#8216;rules&#8217; do you apply?

What:

We&#8217;re holding a GeekUp style meet in Hebden Bridge, open to anyone who is a geeky about anything.

There is no formal agenda or presentations planned, we&#8217;ll see how it goes, hope it works and if it does we can to turn it into a regular event.

Most established Geek Ups are primarily aimed at techie geeks - We&#8217;d like to see ours better represent the area and to be something unique. So we&#8217;re throwing the door open to all geeks, if you&#8217;re obsessive about something (tech, beer, music, films, books, knitting&#8230;), come along.

Read more about Geek Ups in general at&nbsp;<a href="http://geekup.org">Geek Up</a>. Questions, comments etc direct them at me here, on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewmccall">@andrewmccall</a> or <a href="mailto:andrew@andrewmccall.com">email</a>.

When I&#8217;m implementing interfaces in a dependent package using Idea/<a href="http://maven.apache.org" class="zem_slink" title="Apache Maven" rel="homepage">Maven</a> I want to tick the &#8220;copy javadoc&#8221; button to at least have the documentation from the intereface. The issue of course is that I don&#8217;t have the sources.

Run the following command:

<code>mvn dependency:sources</code>

Maven will download any sources it can find for in remote repositories for your dependencies and Idea finds them like magic. So now not only can you copy javadoc, you can also click the line number in the stack trace and get something meaningful - not &#8220;compiled code&#8221;.

  <div class="entry-content">As you can tell if you&#8217;ve been here before I finally got around to putting the new design I mostly put together 6 weeks ago when Bill was born, online&nbsp;- It&#8217;s been a busy 6 weeks.

I&#8217;ve been focusing mostly on Sproozi and looking for some seed funding to try to get another developer on board and really get it off the ground. If you know someone who may be interested in investing in a local search and exploration application - let me know. If you know a Java/Hadoop/HBase developer that wants to work on an exciting new project (at least I think it is) - let me know.

Anyway, I hope you like the new look, it&#8217;s basically one gigantic set of dynamic sidebars with widgets. The code is in github if you&#8217;re interested: <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall/hemingway">http://github.com/andrewmccall/hemingway</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">Saw a truly awesome piece of kit on the engadget <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/25/phototrackr-mini-geotagging-device-shrinks-down-adds-mac-and-ra/">website</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gisteq.com/PhotoTrackr/PhotoTrackrDPL900.php">PhotoTrackr mini </a>from GiSTEQ. It&#8217;s a little USB dongle that you carry around with you and it logs your route as you go. When you&#8217;re done you plug it in and use the software to add geo data about where you were when you took the picture.

It&#8217;s less than &pound;50 and what&#8217;s best, it exports the logs as NEMA and GPX.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve had an ongoing conversation with a few people over the course of a few projects about the questions to ask when people sign up on the web or what hoops you make them jump through.

Ask most people what they need to know about user&#8217;s and you&#8217;ll end up with a list of information from the useful like name to the truly useless like job title or title. Give me one good reason for either. Are you going to be sending Mr John Smith or Dr. Sarah Jones a letter using their formal titles?

When it comes to things like Job Title, the reason I usually hear is that it&#8217;ll be useful for marketing and demographics later. Maybe, but I&#8217;ve never actually seen that later come to anything. So I don&#8217;t buy it.

If the signup form is the depth of your engagement with your user you might as well drop the pretense of a web application and go back to sending newsletters.&nbsp;Just don&#8217;t do it. Ask your user the bare minimum number of questions you need to get them started using what your product does now and stop throwing up barriers to entry.

Aside from just the questions that are asked there are other things, the hoops almost every site makes you jump through before you can start using it. Probably the best example is the ubiquitous confirm your email step. Do we need to be doing this?&nbsp;In some circumstances I&#8217;ll admit it makes sense, if your delivering content via email for example or signing up for a mailing list. Of course you want to make sure the user wants what you&#8217;re sending them.

But for every other site, I&#8217;m not sold. It&#8217;s just another step they have to take to start using your service and all the little steps all add up to users hating signing up for new things.

Also it begs the question, why even bother? For 99% of websites the only reason to make sure a user has entered their email address correctly is so that you can let them recover a password. You&#8217;re adding the step for people that have lost their password and haven&#8217;t managed to get their email right. That&#8217;s going to be a fairly small proportion of your users; even less if you let login with their email address, then they&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s wrong anyway as soon as they try it.

Do we pander to the idiots or make things as quick and easy for everyone else? I&#8217;ll take quick an easy any day.

I&#8217;m finding myself not just asking what any given field in a form is for and making it justify it&#8217;s self, I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to get by without it.&nbsp;I&#8217;m leaning towards going beyond just the bare minimum and into the realm of how can I modify this service to work with even less.
