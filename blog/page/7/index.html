  <div class="entry-content">Sorry if you came here wondering if you should <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow" class="zem_slink" title="Nofollow" rel="wikipedia">nofollow</a> comments or something else on your site or blog, but I&#8217;m looking at it more from a crawler&#8217;s perspective. Though if that is why you&#8217;re here you&nbsp;have something to add.

Basically the nofollow either in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element" class="zem_slink" title="Meta element" rel="wikipedia">meta tags</a> or as a rel attribute of an a tag is a hint to a crawler telling it, in it&#8217;s most basic terms, not to follow the link.&nbsp;But what does that really mean to me, if I run the crawler? More importantly, how is it actually being used?&nbsp;

On blogs, personal websites and even wikipedia the nofollow policy is pretty clear and transparently aimed at preventing spam - and it works.

But how are they applied? Well,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-google-yahoo-askcom-treat-the-no-follow-link-attribute/4801/">not even the big search engines treat them consistently</a>: Google completely blanks them, Yahoo indexes them but adds no juice, and Ask doesn&#8217;t even support them [Granted this article may be somewhat out of date].&nbsp;

One interesting thing that came out of the answers though, was the one from Google:&nbsp;
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">On a related note, though, and echoing Matt&rsquo;s earlier sentiments&hellip; we hope and expect that more and more sites &mdash; including Wikipedia &mdash; will adopt a less-absolute approach to no-follow&hellip; expiring no-follows, not applying no-follows to trusted contributors, and so on.</blockquote>
So within even Google, with the&nbsp;strictest&nbsp;application of a nofollow policy, there is certainly a strong argument and use case for treating this as a hint as opposed to a policy. I&#8217;m not even sure why Google needs wikipedia to make a policy change, everything they hope for could be implemented at their end.&nbsp;

A link on wikipeida, if it&#8217;s been there long enough, probably deserves some juice. And that same logic applies to any site, even your blog - nofollow is a hint to a search engine. It&#8217;s there to deter spam, but if a link sticks around then by not removing it, to a point, the site is endorsing it.&nbsp;

For our application we&#8217;re working from a slightly different angle - there aren&#8217;t a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging" class="zem_slink" title="Geotagging" rel="wikipedia">geotagged</a>&nbsp;urls and there isn&#8217;t much span so at least&nbsp;initially&nbsp;we want as many as we can get. So we may not index or pass juice on to the site, at least initially, but we do want to follow the link.&nbsp;

  <div class="entry-content">Increasing prices, obviously, can help your bottom line - as long as you don&#8217;t&nbsp;alienate&nbsp;you users in the process by increasing them too much. But what if you&#8217;re running a fremium model, free&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;for users hoping that the features of a paid for account are inticing enough that they&#8217;ll give you money, and it becomes too expensive to service them. Can you get away with moving to a paid only model&gt;

The move from 0 to even 0.01 is an infinite jump&nbsp;especially&nbsp;in the eyes of your users, if for no other reason than you&#8217;re asking them to do something else; put in credit card details. So I think&nbsp;It&#8217;s going to be interesting to watch Zoto who are <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/02/28/zoto/#">moving from a fremium model to one with only paid accounts</a> [via mashable]

I think they&#8217;ll probably suffer short term, certainly in visitor numbers, but that does it really matter long term as long as they&#8217;re&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;paying customers? Even if the number they&#8217;re&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;on a monthly basis drops off those users aren&#8217;t paying the costs of the freeloaders, so Zoto may actually be better off with lower levels.&nbsp;

Anyway, if I remember I&#8217;ll probably check back and see how things go in a few months.

  <div class="entry-content">A question most web companies in the US probably don&#8217;t have to worry aboutbut one almost all British ones must is, do we write our pages in British English or American English?

Building applications I&#8217;ve had more than a few conversations with <a href="http://twitter.com/Simon_Chapman" title="Simon on twitter">@Simon_Chapman</a>&nbsp;about it - we want to appeal to an international audience so the framework for internationalisation is already in place. Java web applications make it pretty easy anyway, we just take the time to build the application, even if we&#8217;re starting with a single language version, as a properly internationalised application.&nbsp;

Jakob Nielsen talks about it <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/american-british-english.html">here</a> as well and I agree with most of what he says, which basically comes down to the fact that it&#8217;s all about the users. If you&#8217;re targeting a British audience than you should write for them, if you&#8217;re targeting an American audience then you should write for them. If you&#8217;re targeting an international audience you should translate - it really isn&#8217;t that difficult.&nbsp;

  <div class="entry-content">Andrew Hyde posted &#8221;<a href="http://andrewhyde.net/a-message-to-twitter-spammers/">A Message to Twitter Spammers</a>&#8221; suggesting that something needed to be done, but does it really? In my comments to his post I asked if it was really&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;for Twitter to go that far, and weather it was really a problem at all.&nbsp;
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I&#8217;m not sure they need to go so far as to ban users that do it. As twitter grows communities are going to form around the speakers that have the most to offer. If the people mass following then unfollowing have nothing to say eventually their followers are going to move on.</blockquote>
The problem I have with wanting Twitter to do something about this is that it seems to me to be an argument by people who feel like they&#8217;ve earned their following against people they feel haven&#8217;t. An argument you could interpret at elitst and at it&#8217;s most base level it&#8217;s just users upset that they&#8217;re now having to deal with their&nbsp;

Now I&#8217;m not suggesting for a second that Andrew Hyde or anyone else is churlish, childish or elitist. I wouldn&#8217;t follow him either on Twitter or his blog if I though so.&nbsp;I think it&#8217;s far more likely that most users are just seeing an increase in people following them as Twitter becomes more and more mainstream. They&#8217;re also seeing a lot of followers who are plainly gaming the system to inflate their&nbsp;perceived&nbsp;influence; dealing with that on a daily basis is&nbsp;frustrating ,&nbsp;I&#8217;m sure.

In my comment I tried to make the point that all these users were gaining a thin perception that at a glance they matter. But that&nbsp;I don&#8217;t think it makes any real difference and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth wasting time lobbying for change because these users really aren&#8217;t building a following at all. Despite what the numbers may indicate.
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I don&#8217;t see an audience on twitter as being any different from an audience anywhere. Any idiot can get one, just walk into a crowded room and start shouting. Keeping them is what matters. An audience that isn&#8217;t engaged or doesn&#8217;t care, doesn&#8217;t matter.</blockquote>
I could show up in the houses of&nbsp;parliament&nbsp;and shout my message out at MPs, get on the news in the process and have it heard by hundreds, even thousands of people of influence - but they&#8217;d label my message the ravings of a lunatic and even if they were amused would quickly move on with their lives.&nbsp;
<blockquote>Nothing twitter can do will stop the type of people that only care about the number of people listening to them from caring about that. What might be better is if tools like <a href="http://twitter.grader.com">http://twitter.grader.com</a> gave weight to the longevity of your engagement with a follower and took churn rates into account. These are in my mind more important numbers for the people that want to measure things to pay attention to. In my mind someone who is steadily gaining and keeping followers at the rate of one a day has a far more compelling message than someone getting a thousand and losing half within a week.</blockquote>
The solution is to focus on numbers that matter, if you&#8217;re going to focus on them at all, and the key to any social network or service is to care about how engaged your are with that network. High&nbsp;proportionate&nbsp;churn rates are a pretty clear indication that users are not engaged and if they&#8217;re not engaged, they&#8217;re not listening.

I&#8217;m not part of the twitter elite, my opinion doesn&#8217;t really matter. If someone follows me I tend to follow them back, but since I&#8217;m not a person of any great influence I probably don&#8217;t get quite the level of requests some do. I&#8217;m doing my best to follow people interesting and working in similar fields, to me some level of engagement with a hundred followers would be better than shouting at ten thousand.&nbsp;

  <div class="entry-content">We launched the crawler a while ago now and the results are impressive and even a little surprising in some respects, while in others they&#8217;re not. Basically we&#8217;re happy we found a few thousand pages with geotags on the first crawl though the longer we&#8217;ve let it go the lower the ratio gets. Totally expected because we seeded it with pages we knew were geotagged in the first place.&nbsp;

To get more pages, we&#8217;ve started using the mechanical turk. We&#8217;re hoping to get pages that aren&#8217;t otherwise tagged added by real people. Once we launch this is obviously going to be a function of the site, something we want any user to be able to do. In the meantime I&#8217;m tweaking our turk jobs and starting to get some good data back, though not as much as we&#8217;d like - we&#8217;ll probably have to up the cost.&nbsp;

I&#8217;ll let you know how it turns out, in the meantime if anyone has any experience with turk, any hints or thoughts - let me know.&nbsp;

  <div class="entry-content">A large part of the assumptions we&#8217;re making with goroam are based around the idea that local business wants to capitalise on the Internet to bring in business. But it&#8217;s not easy. How do promote a book store, toy shop, cafe or plumber in your local area online, now imagine you have a books and toys to sell, coffees and tea to make or houses without hot water to help - in short, a full time job that doesn&#8217;t leave much time for SEO, SEM, analytics and tweaking a website and search advertising strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;

We&#8217;re not just pulling the assumption out of thin air though- helping local business market online is big business,&nbsp;Yodle&#8217;s<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/BLLJYMvh38I/"> 700% growth last year and $10M C round</a> is a great example of this trend and from the techcrunch article, they&#8217;re not the only ones in the game.&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.yodle.com/" class="zem_slink" title="Yodle" rel="homepage">Yodle</a> competes against a number of similar, venture-backed companies such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/reachlocal" target="_blank">ReachLocal</a>(which raised a substantial $65 million in funding to date),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/merchantcircle" target="_blank">MerchantCircle</a>&nbsp;(which raised its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/07/merchantcircle-takes-10-million-series-b/" target="_blank">$10 million in Series B funding round</a>&nbsp;in November 2007),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ingenio" target="_blank">Ingenio</a>&nbsp;(acquired by AT&amp;T, also in November 2007),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/webvisible" target="_blank">WebVisible</a>&nbsp;(total funding: $17 million) and a plethora of smaller companies trying to get their piece of the pie.</blockquote>
So we&#8217;ve got the social proof, now we just have to capitalise on it and bring something to market that makes it easy for small businesses to target their services at the people in their area who are interested.&nbsp;

I&#8217;ve been a bit quiet lately, but not inactive. I&#8217;ve been working very hard on our location based service project- A better way to search and explore things around you.

Right now everything we&#8217;re doing is happening in the background, laying the ground work for the things to come. Background things like our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">crawler</a>.

I finished the first milestone for our <a href="http://goroam.net/crawler">crawler</a> a few days ago and set it loose on the internet. It&#8217;s been crawling from my laptop, then I moved it to our hosted server and let it do a few crawls from there.

After a few teething issues it&#8217;s finally managed to cross a bit of a milestone - 250,000 pages downloaded, approximately 3000 of them with geo tags have been indexed. I feel a bit like a proud parent, and have spent far too much time just watching the crawl take place.

<strong>What it&#8217;s looking for</strong>
First and probably most important is for any pages that have been geo tagged; second the structure and links to/from a page are being analysed to help create a picture of how important a page is both in an area and in general.

I&#8217;ll try and pop my head above the parapet here and on the <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a> site more and more often as we get closer to a launch to try and fill in more of the blanks.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve made some progress over the last few days getting things working towards getting the crawler online and came across a scenario where git would have been useful and had one of those epiphany&nbsp;movements&nbsp;when distributed development clicked and it made sense to me.&nbsp;

The first run of our crawler is based on a pretty vanilla nutch install with some plugins; it works already and saves us an awful lot of leg work. The first thing I wanted to do was quickly mavenise it so we could better integrate it into our development environment. Problem is if I pull the trunk, I can&#8217;t commit and update from our own internal repository and the Apache one.&nbsp;

I intend at some point, once it&#8217;s working and I&#8217;m happy with it, to submit a patch back to the <a href="http://www.apache.org/" class="zem_slink" title="Apache Software Foundation" rel="homepage">ASF&nbsp;</a>but in the short term I just want to share my fork with other developers on my team. This is where git would come in.&nbsp;Next I was hoping to start to move the configuration over to the springframework IOC controller, to see if/how it works or doesn&#8217;t, again I&#8217;d submit the patches if the community was interested.&nbsp;

When I get a bit of time in the next few weeks I think I&#8217;ll install a central git repository for our dev environment and trial a transition there. Has anyone tried something similar, is git what I&#8217;m looking for?&nbsp;

  <div class="entry-content">I use the <a href="http://diythemes.com?a_aid=andrewmccall">thesis</a> theme, we bought a developer licence a few months ago and I&#8217;ve used it as the basis for a few websites including this one and the goroam site. One thing I&#8217;ve been meaning to do with both was to start to move them away from the default thesis theme - not because the them is bad, in anyway just so this isn&#8217;t just another default thesis blog.

That&#8217;s been the plan for the last 4 months. In the new year I&#8217;m going to actually make some of the changes.

One of the first things I want to do is start to put some of my own pictures in the rotating box. Ideally I&#8217;d love to have it pull from my public flickr stream (incidentally, something else on my resolutions list for the new year is to start using flickr more). After that I&#8217;d like to do something with the design to make it more&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;and more mine, lets see how it goes.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;m going to need to act with a little more purpose in the new year, I&#8217;ve been at the crossroads for a number of weeks and been distracted. Job loss, Christmas and all the fall out of the two kind of had me standing still. I wasn&#8217;t actually standing still, but I wasn&#8217;t anywhere near as productive as I should have been or as I&#8217;m used to being. Other things just got in they way, not the least of which was my the&nbsp;pursuit&nbsp;of more than just &#8220;see-ya, best of luck!&#8221; from my previous employer; an ongoing process, but now out of my hands so I can refocus on what is actually important. &nbsp;

As a family we&#8217;re in a position to stave off the wolves until at least March. It won&#8217;t be&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;the most comfortable standard of living, but we won&#8217;t have to move and we certainly wont starve - we&#8217;ll just have to cut out some luxuries. I&#8217;m actively looking for any bits of work we might get to quote for in the new year.

I&#8217;m also&nbsp;polishing&nbsp;up my CV over the holidays and I&#8217;ll be sending that out anywhere that looks like a good opportunity. I&#8217;m not sure how easy it&#8217;s going to be to replace the 2 1/2 days a week I worked for my previous employer though. So full time offers might be a tough call, and they&#8217;d depend on the progress we&#8217;re making with <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a> and the position and the opportunity it offers. I wouldn&#8217;t expect a prospective employer &nbsp;to back me any less than 100%, so I couldn&#8217;t in good faith take a job unless I could give them the same.&nbsp;

In the meantime I&#8217;m working on <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam&#8217;s</a> newest project. A local search and exploration application, we&#8217;ve been working on the goals for a few months now (as I said above, I&#8217;ve been a bit distracted, so it&#8217;s been a lot of talk), and I think we&#8217;ve got a pretty good idea of where we&#8217;re going. I&#8217;ve enlisted the help of a friend a fellow coder to give me a hand getting it out the door with some evening and weekend work in his spare time. I&#8217;ve finished most of the user management stuff and started&nbsp;wireframimg&nbsp;up the core pages and they&#8217;re really coming together well. &nbsp;I think I&#8217;m going to start posting details as they emerge and we&#8217;ll be running an open beta as soon as enough features come together for a release.&nbsp;

Basically I&#8217;m doing everything I can to make sure I don&#8217;t run out of money in the new year, and everything I can to protect myself against the loss of earnings from loosing the major part of my income. If anyone out there knows of any work going, drop me a line: andrew[dot]mccall[at]goraom[dot]net - we do bespoke coding,&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;and web projects in a number of languages from <a href="http://php.net/" class="zem_slink" title="PHP" rel="homepage">PHP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages" class="zem_slink" title="Active Server Pages" rel="wikipedia">ASP</a> to <a href="http://java.sun.com" class="zem_slink" title="Java (programming language)" rel="homepage">Java</a>.&nbsp;
