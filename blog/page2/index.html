		    When I recently rebuilt my development server using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>&nbsp;I decided not to backup my nexus repository since there were all of three files I'd built in there.

If you intended to do some work here it's probably a really good idea to take the advice the message gives you and create a branch. You could do that when you checkout by adding -b</div><p /><div>[code]git checkout &lt;TAG_NAME&gt; -b &lt;BRANCH_NAME&gt;[/code]</div><p /><div>I didn't want to do anything except a [code]mvn clean deploy[/code] to get my library deployed back to nexus, then get back to where I was.

		    I've been a bit quiet on the server front and to be honest a bit stuck. I'm new to Puppet and it took me a while to figure out how to get users working the way I wanted them to. Sleeping on it and reading some more and eventually I got there. I also have a day job to hold down and a family to entertain on the weekend, so as much as I really wanted to get this done life got in the way.

		    Last night I got the server upgraded to ububtu 10.04 and installed puppet. The first and only recipe we've got is one to make sure our sudoers file has the proper permissions. Tonight I'm hoping to:
<ul>
	<li>Add myself a user</li>
	<li>Automatically create me ssh key</li>
	<li>Prevent root from logging in via ssh</li>
	<li>Prevent users from logging in other than with a key.</li>
	<li>It would be nice to be able to email me my key since I don't run puppet on my mac, though I may be convinced to go down that route if it proves too difficult.</li>
</ul>
Longer term I'm hoping to extend this same process to create user certificates for https client certificate authentication and it would be nice to use the same key, certificates and revocation process to issue new credential to users or to even lock them out. Bearing that all in mind, but not getting too hung up on stuff I'm doing later, off we go.

		    Things around here have stalled a bit I've not had much free time what with a new job and travelling. The time I have had I've spent getting a build server setup. Replacing my ageing <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a>/<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/" class="zem_slink" title="Subversion (software)" rel="homepage">subversion</a> install is something I've meant to do for a while and just never got around to.
