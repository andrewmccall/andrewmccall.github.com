		    I have a real problem with bookmarks. Actually I have a few problems with bookmarks: There are too many, they're a mess, they don't make any sense and I can't search them. Basically they're a good idea, really badly implemented.

		    A few months ago we announced Citrus, a suite of tools we'd been developing for estate agents. Despite our bullish attitude to building and selling the application we've taken a step back over recent weeks and taken a long hard look at what it is we're doing. The result of the look is a change of direction, back to some ideas we've had in the past about personal search, bookmarking and some location based services. It's a bit too early to get into too much detail about what we're planing but I wanted to take the time to give a bit of an explanation of why we've changed our minds.&nbsp;

		    I've been trying to figure this out for months, and thought it should have been simple. All I wanted to do was write a set of unit tests to test my java code, have them run whenever I hit test. Next I wanted to have a set of HTTP Unit, Selenium or similar tests run to test that the actual application is working when it's built and deployed to a container using the cargo plugin.

		    Again, I'm here apologising for letting things slip a little. I've been busy and posting has unfortunately suffered for it. I've been working hard trying to get things moving for <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a>, and it's been time consuming. I basically spend the last half of last year bogged down with a project and had no time at all to spend on it, so for the last half of this year the focus is really to turn it around, launch a few things and start bringing some revenue in.

		    You may notice that this site has yet another new design today. I've left blogger and gone back to wordpress and hosted the blog. I like Blogger and I really like the idea of hosted applications but it just wasn't giving me the control I wanted and I was finding it&nbsp;time consuming&nbsp;to get things the way I wanted.&nbsp;
<h1>It's not you, it's me.</h1>
Hosted applications are great and Blogger has got to be one of the best free ones out there. I really do like it, but we wanted to make all our goroam pages consistent, so we bought the great <a href="http://diythemes.com/thesis/">thesis theme from diythemes</a>. We bought a developer licence so we could use it on all our sites and would be free to modify it.&nbsp;

		    <p>The back button is one of the strongest and most pervasive conventions available to developers, yet some fail to use it correctly and see it as a burden rather than a resource. The fact of the matter is all users great and small know it's there. From novice to expert they quickly learn to know and use the back button and taking that away from them in your application, well there is no excuse for it. </p>
