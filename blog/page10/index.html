		    A few months ago we announced Citrus, a suite of tools we'd been developing for estate agents. Despite our bullish attitude to building and selling the application we've taken a step back over recent weeks and taken a long hard look at what it is we're doing. The result of the look is a change of direction, back to some ideas we've had in the past about personal search, bookmarking and some location based services. It's a bit too early to get into too much detail about what we're planing but I wanted to take the time to give a bit of an explanation of why we've changed our minds.&nbsp;

The market has changed, there is no doubt, but we know that. On reflection though we decided our assumptions were probably wrong. We knew there were not going to be a lot of new players entering the market but existing&nbsp;businesses probably aren't going to want to change, software tools and they're not going to want to part with money especially if they had already paid to have a site developed and especially if they're being forced to lose people.

Then came the next blow to the project, &nbsp;we were asked to shut down the only current user of our software. They'd decided to put their business on hold because of changes to the&nbsp;Spanish&nbsp;regulations and the current state of the market. &nbsp;So now we were facing selling a product, in an unfriendly market without our&nbsp;evangelist.&nbsp;

I'd also be lying if I said that we had generated the interest we'd hoped to generate, we didn't. It goes without saying that had we generated that interest, or close to that interest we wouldn't have had the moment of introspection and we wouldn't have needed to take this difficult decision.

		    I've been trying to figure this out for months, and thought it should have been simple. All I wanted to do was write a set of unit tests to test my java code, have them run whenever I hit test. Next I wanted to have a set of HTTP Unit, Selenium or similar tests run to test that the actual application is working when it's built and deployed to a container using the cargo plugin.

I didn't really want to have a separate project to do this because it seemed like a massive pain in the ass to maintain the whole thing. I didn't see any reason why it shouldn't be easy with Maven either - it does have a phase for integration-tests already.

My first try looked good to me:

                    &lt;configuration&gt;
                        &lt;excludes&gt;
                            &lt;exclude&gt;none&lt;/exclude&gt;
                        &lt;/excludes&gt;
                        &lt;includes&gt;
                            &lt;include&gt;**/integration/**/*Test*.java&lt;/include&gt;
                            &lt;include&gt;**/integration/**/*Test.java&lt;/include&gt;

                        &lt;/includes&gt;
                    &lt;/configuration&gt;
                &lt;/execution&gt;
            &lt;/executions&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
    ...
&lt;/build&gt;
...</pre></div>
</div>

</code>

&nbsp;

I tried to run the tests, but unfortunately when it gets to the second round of tests - which should run my integration tests - it runs the same sets of as it ran the first time. I tried adding the <code>combine.children="append"</code> attribute to the includes, and excludes but that didn't work either. Finally I came across a source file <a href="http://plexus.codehaus.org/plexus-utils/xref/org/codehaus/plexus/util/xml/Xpp3Dom.html">XppDom</a>, part of plexus which maven uses. XppDom allowed the combine.children attribute as well as another I haven't seen mentioned anywhere else <code>childMergeOverride</code>. I added that instead and it worked!

<h2>Setting it up for Cargo</h2>
I've done this on a few projects, the first was a project that built a series of taglibs which are used across a number of applications. The release for the project is a jar so I have a separate test web-app structure in <code>${baseDir}/src/test/web-app</code>.  The code for generating this war looks like this:

&nbsp;

<code>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>...
&lt;build&gt;
    ...
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        ...
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-war-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;executions&gt;
                &lt;execution&gt;
                    &lt;id&gt;generate-test-war&lt;/id&gt;
                    &lt;phase&gt;pre-integration-test&lt;/phase&gt;
                    &lt;goals&gt;
                        &lt;goal&gt;war&lt;/goal&gt;
                    &lt;/goals&gt;
                &lt;/execution&gt;
            &lt;/executions&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;warSourceDirectory&gt;${basedir}/src/test/webapp&lt;/warSourceDirectory&gt;
                &lt;warName&gt;${project.artifactId}-test&lt;/warName&gt;
                &lt;webappDirectory&gt;${basedir}/target/${project.artifactId}-test&lt;/webappDirectory&gt;
                &lt;primaryArtifact&gt;false&lt;/primaryArtifact&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
    ...
&lt;/build&gt;
...</pre></div>
</div>

&nbsp;

During the pre-integration-test phase the above simple generates a test war. If you're project is a web-app and it already generates a war you can skip the above as one will be generated for you already.

The next step for was then to get Cargo to deploy the application:

&nbsp;

<code>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>...
&lt;build&gt;
    ...
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        ...

            &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.cargo&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;cargo-maven2-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;wait&gt;false&lt;/wait&gt;
                &lt;container&gt;
                    &lt;containerId&gt;tomcat5x&lt;/containerId&gt;
                    &lt;zipUrlInstaller&gt;
                        &lt;url&gt;${integrationtests.tomcatURL}&lt;/url&gt;
                        &lt;installDir&gt;${installDir}&lt;/installDir&gt;
                    &lt;/zipUrlInstaller&gt;
                    &lt;output&gt;
                        ${project.build.directory}/tomcat5x.log
                    &lt;/output&gt;
                    &lt;log&gt;${project.build.directory}/cargo.log&lt;/log&gt;
                &lt;/container&gt;
                &lt;configuration&gt;
                    &lt;home&gt;
                        ${project.build.directory}/tomcat5x/container

Most of this is pretty self explanatory, I try to use parameters to configure as much as I can and try to maintain it in higher level POMs wherever appropriate. This is especially true for the tomcat URL which changes on a regular basis. The seem to post new releases and remove the older ones, and it can be a chore to keep up in multiple projects. You may want to look at the cargo plugin documentation, you can ignore some of what I'm doing above if you're project's default artifact (the one package creates) is a web-app.&nbsp;

So there you have it, eventually I got there after a lot of digging. I've been pretty brief in my explanations and have assumed a fairly good understanding of maven. if you have any questions by all means leave a comment and I'll do my best to make it clearer.<h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">

		    Again, I'm here apologising for letting things slip a little. I've been busy and posting has unfortunately suffered for it. I've been working hard trying to get things moving for <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a>, and it's been time consuming. I basically spend the last half of last year bogged down with a project and had no time at all to spend on it, so for the last half of this year the focus is really to turn it around, launch a few things and start bringing some revenue in. 

Our biggest project at the moment is running an online marketing campaign for <a href="http://mediqol.com">Mediqol</a> a medical device consultancy. Our lofty goal is to show up in the first position for the search keywords <a href="http://mediqol.com">medical device</a>, short term we're just interested in optimising the adwords campaigns, and increasing organic traffic for the keywords we know work.

Then there is <a href="http://citrusapp.com">Citrus</a> - Work is progressing, but we might be looking at an end of the year launch for it. My gut feeling is that we won't be anything approaching a launch before the end of November.

In the meantime we're looking into a couple of smaller launches. I have a couple of ideas for tools and products that tie into the <a href="http://citrusapp.com">Citrus</a> roadmap that we can launch. 

I'm going to spend some time this afternoon and weekend writing some posts to get on top of it again.

		    I wanted to write something else today, but instead I'm recovering my laptop because I decided to "quickly" upgrade from Tiger to Lepoard this morning. Everything looked to be going perfectly and I figured I'd got away without any major problems - that is until I tried to login. 

Unfortunately there is an all too common bug with upgrading a system that has a filevault user - in short it doesn't fucking work! I'm the only user on my laptop and when I tried to log in after the upgrade all I got was an error message: 

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">"Your FileVault-protected home folder did not open and needs to be repaired. Click OK to repair the folder and continue logging in. Click Cancel Login to log in as a different user" </blockquote>

<strong>oh fuck</strong>. 

I'd like this part of the story to be the part where I say, it's all ok because I had backups, but it's not. I had my daughter in my arms and was flying one handed, she'd just dozed off for a short nap and I didn't want to wake her up so I didn't reach down, unplug the external drive from my desktop machine, I didn't plug it into my laptop and I didn't back up my files. 

<strong>oh fuck</strong>. 

I clicked OK, waited a few seconds and hoped for the best...

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">"Logging into the account failed because an error occurred"</blockquote>

<strong>oh fuck</strong>. 

Now it sinks in, what was meant to be a nice little morning project, upgrade my OS has turned into a total nightmare. Here are the steps to sort it out, they worked for me and hopefully will help someone else. 

<h1>Reset the root password, so you can login</h1>

Restart you machine with the install disk in the drive and hold the <strong>c</strong> key to boot from the disk. 

Select your instalation language, accept the agreements and click continue. When it's loaded choose reset password from the utilities list. Choose your system drive and select <em>System Administrator (root)</em> from the list of users. Set a password and click save. 

<h1>Login as root</h1>

Close all the windows and quit the Mac OS X Installer, when your prompted to select a startup disk choose your hard disk. 

Now you login screen should have an option to log in as another user, pick this and use the username root and the password you set above. You should now get a new desktop from here you'll be able to recover your files. 

<h1>Get your files</h1>

Open finder and browse to the Users folder. Find your user and in there you should find a file called <em>username</em>.sparseimage. 

I tried to back the whole file up to my external drive, but couldn't get it to copy in either Finder or terminal.

So just double click it to mount it as a disk. You'll be asked to type a password, it's your user password for the account. Type it and click ok. 

Finder will start to mount the disk then stop with the following message:

[[posterous-content:rmwCBzHoHbAzHynFntja]]

You've got nothing to lose here, it's mount it or lose everything so just go ahead and click Open. 

[[posterous-content:bseEujfzkIrcoDisDuIk]]

So it can't read it properly, just click ok. You should now have a drive mounted and it has all your files in there. Time to back them all up, except they probably won't all back up. I tried that and got some permission issues, rather then worry too much about them I ignored them and just made sure I got all my documents, pictures, music, movies and the application settings I wanted, I ignored everything else. 

I have a lot of files and this took a very long time, the lesson I've learned - back up more often. Ironically that's part of the reason I wanted to upgrade, so timemachine would do this for me... but I digress. 

<h1>Recover</h1>

At this point you have a choice. You can create a new users, move files into it and move on with your upgraded system. Since I was tempted to wipe the system and start again when I considered installing the OS I chose to go that route. I rebooted, used disk utility to clean the drive and started again from fresh. 

Either way from you backups and your new user you should be able to either do a recovery and get more or less back to where you wanted to be.  

<h1>Rant</h1>

Filevault is promoted as a great security feature of the OS. I like it, I deal with the fact that my machine is somewhat slower for using it, but I feel the benefits if for any reason my laptop is lost or stolen far outweigh the inconviniences. 

I haven't really had any problems with my mac before now and I don't see any reason that my system should be anything but standard. Since I'm <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=5881960">not the only one that has been experiencing these issues</a>, one can only assume it's fairly widespread. 

If only I'd know, I could have saved myself hours by simply turning file vault off. I mean I took the trouble to reboot once and clean up my home directory so the OS could fully recover it's space.

To anyone reading this contemplating an upgrade, <strong>TURN FILEVAULT OFF FIRST!</strong>

<h1>The good news</h1>

The only good to come from the whole experience is that I ended up with the clean install I kinda wanted anyway. Though not really through choice. 

Also next time I'll be running a simple google search for "snow lepoard upgrade problems" first and hopefully timemachine means I'll have consistent backups, before I start.

	        </h1>
        </div>
		<div class="content">
		    In my <a href="http://andrewmccall.com/2008/07/get_your_contractors/">last post</a> I promised I'd write another about <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="Subversion (software)" class="zem_slink" rel="homepage">subversion</a> and how to set things up to work with contractors. I was supposed to post this the next day, but I got <a href="http://andrewmccall.com/2008/07/ive-been-a-little-slack-with-the-posting/">caught up with other things</a>. 

Anyway, let's just jump right in...

We run all our projects out of one big subversion repository, some people create a repository per project or group projects into a number repositories. In all honesty it really doesn't matter how you group things, I think that one repository works better for us, I can move things around and I can allow people access to all or parts of the repository. You may feel differently, but for the time being I'm going to assume you're working with a single repository like us. 

<h1>getting started: installing apache, subversion and mod_dav_svn</h1>

I recently upgraded to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="Subversion (software)" class="zem_slink" rel="homepage">Subversion</a> 1.5, there wasn't a package available for the version of <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" title="Fedora (operating system)" class="zem_slink" rel="homepage">Fedora</a> we're running on our server so I had to build it. It was a relatively painless process of simply making sure dependencies existed and following the instructions in the INSTALL file. 

<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html">http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html</a>

Go do that now, get subversion and mod_dav_svn installed. There are more than enough resources out there on how to install subversion that I'm not going to go into too much detail about building from source or installing on any specific platform. 

In fact since the steps and concepts I'm going over in this post don't require a specific version I'll just throw up some common defaults.

If you're on a <a href="http://www.redhat.com" title="Red Hat" class="zem_slink" rel="homepage">Red Hat</a> based linux system try:
<code> 
# yum install subversion
# yum install mod_dav_svn
</code>

If you're on a <a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="Debian" class="zem_slink" rel="homepage">Debian</a> based system try: 
<code>
# apt-get install subversion
# apt-get install libapache2-svn
</code>

In your apache configuration file, near the module declarations make sure you have the following lines. 

<code>LoadModule dav_module      /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_svn_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</code>

<h1>setting up a repository</h1>

Again moving quite quickly here, there are tons of other better resources for getting started with Subversion on the web, better than I could hope to write. The basic command you need to run simply creates the directory structure that subversion needs. 

<code>$ svnadmin create /path/to/repo</code>

It's usually best to create this somewhere near, but not in the document tree for the webserver. 

Open you're apache config file, or the config file that stores the details for the virtual host you're using and add the following lines: 

<code>
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /path/to/your/repository
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/your/passwdfile
</code>

Now create the htpasswd file and add a user or two using the following commands

<code># htpasswd -cm # htpasswd -cm /etc/svn-passwd andrew
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user andrew

# htpasswd /etc/svn-passwd -m simon
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user simon 
</code>

Restart apache and that's it all done. You should now have a running subversion repository with two users, andrew and simon, they should be able to view and commit anywhere. We'll assume these are staff members who can view and commit on any project. 

<h1>Setting up for an external contractor</h1>

Now you want to bring a contractor in on a project, so let's create them a user: 

<code>
# htpasswd /etc/svn-passwd -m john
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user john 
</code>

The next thing you need to do is to setup svnauthz to control access to the repository. Back in your apache config file, add the following line into your svn config: 

<code>AuthzSVNAccessFile /home/goroam/dev.goroam.net/user/repos/svn-authz
</code>

So that it looks something like this: 

<code>
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /path/to/your/repository
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/your/passwdfile
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/your/repository/svn-authz
</code>

I tend to keep my svn-authz file within my repository path, you may wish to place it elsewhere - whatever works best for you. 

The next step is to create the svn-authz file. That's as simple as this: 
<code>
[groups]
staff = andrew, simon
contractors = john

[/] 
@staff = rw
* = r

[/external-project]
@contractors = rw
</code>

The file is pretty simple and self explanatory but the first block starting with <em>[groups]</em> defines the groups. In this case we've got two one for staff with andrew and simon and one for contractors with john as the single member. The usernames to use here are the same as you set in your htpasswd file. Authentication is controlled by the standard basic authentication, subversion is only controlling access. 

The next two blocks are paths within the repository. The first: 

<code>
[/] 
@staff = rw
* = r
</code>

Tells subversion to give all members of the staff group <strong>r</strong>ead and <strong>w</strong>rite access to everything under the <strong>/</strong> path - basically the whole repository. The next line <strong>* = r</strong> tells subversion to give everyone else, read access to everything. 

Again this may not work for you, but we tend to allow read access to everything to everyone with a password. If we trust them enough to give them a password, we trust them. Also it allows contractors to build dependant libraries from the head, which is required at times and saves us the trouble of working out dependencies in our svn-authz file. 

<code>
[/external-project]
@contractors = rw
</code>

In the next block, above, we're giving everyone in the contractors group <strong>r</strong>ead and  <strong>w</strong>rite access to everything in the <strong>/external-project</strong> path of our repository. This of course is the project they're currently working, so your path will be different. 

That's it. Contractors hired, up and running in your subversion in minutes.

<h1>Slightly more complicated, but easy now that you know how</h1>

Let's just complicate things a little bit by adding two external contractors from the first company and a third from second working on two different projects. 

Let's say that CompanyA Limited are working on project-x. They've asked us to create accounts for Dick and Jane. Then we hire Dave from CompanyB to add a feature called zing-bang to project-y. You could, of course just create two accounts, one for each company - but we tend to avoid that. We like to know <strong>WHO</strong> committed what code. Not just where they were from, we work closely with our contractors and it helps us when we're communicating with them. 

We know how to create the users, but just to recap here we go again:

<code>
# htpasswd /etc/svn-passwd -m dick
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user dick

# htpasswd /etc/svn-passwd -m jane
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user jane

# htpasswd /etc/svn-passwd -m dave
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user dave
</code>

Assuming, as above we have andrew and simon as staff users we should make our svn-authz file look something like this: 

<code>
[groups]
staff = andrew, simon
companya = dick, jane
companyb = dave

[/] 
@staff = rw
* = r

[/project-x]
@companya = rw

[/project-y/branches/zing-bang-feature]
@companyb = rw
</code>

We're only building slighty on the previous file with the groups entries, and that should be clear. The entry here for project-x should also look familiar - Both dick and jane, members of the companya group have read and write access to the path. 

For the next entry we've created a branch and we have company b working on the branch. I'm really just throwing that out there, mostly because I can, but also to show that you can go to any depth in the repository tree granting access as you see fit. 

In this case it's been determined that the work CompanyB in engaged to complete only needs to take place in this branch, so while they can read the whole repository they cannot write anywhere except here. This would allow you to continue internal development, or indeed external with some more entries on project-y making point releases while zing-bang feature is developed and CompanyB could merge the trunk in at will, since they have read access to it. 

<h1>a lot of words</h1>

It was a lot of words, but the concepts are pretty simple. It doesn't take long to set subversion up and even with basic auth and htpasswd files it's not complicated to administer. So go on, get your contractors under control. I promise the dividends paid through increased accountability, visibility and communication will more than offset the time spent administrating the system.<h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/collaboratewithsubversion">Collaborate and Connect with Subversion</a></li></ul>

		    I've been busy and haven't had a chance to get things posted like I wanted to. Work and personal commitments have a habit of getting in the way of otherwise good intentions. I'll do my best to get a few posts out this week and I'll see if I can't get caught back up and maybe get a few posts written and scheduled. 

It's been an eventful couple of weeks on a number of fronts - I wouldn't go so far as to say exciting because that would imply all good stuff. Some of it was good, some was bad - other parts just interesting. 

Hopefully we'll be able to push out some good news on the <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a> front in the next few weeks. Despite what our detractors may say or think we are working hard on getting things done - but stuff takes time. Especially when other commitments get in the way. 

In the meantime, where were we?

		    In a recently conversation I was told of a situation which I've experienced in the past and I'm sure others have as well.
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">While on holiday the code I'm responsible for has been modified by an external contractor. Before my holiday I pointed out that we should make sure version control is used by anyone making any change. It wasn't. Now I'm frustrated and pissed off.

The problem isn't that someone else was editing the code, or that I somehow lost control of a fiefdom or anything like that. It's that I've just spent hours I could be using to do something else tracking down file modification dates and then diff'ing them against my versions out of version control. Time I shouldn't have to had spent doing anything

The bigger issue is now I'm under pressure by my boss to deliver some changes at the same time as I have to deal with this, and no extra time has been allowed for it.</blockquote>
You pay contractors to do work for you, a large part of that should be to insist they do it in a way that is consistent with your working practices. You wouldn't let them commit changes to a PHP website in ASP, Perl or Python and equally you should insist  that changes are delivered consistently and in a manageable format.

Warning flags get raised if someone tells me they don't use version control. Not knowing how and asking questions is one thing; I have no problem helping someone, a contractors included, learn our version control system and practices because I see our relationship as a long term one, so any investment in that relationship is worthwhile. If a contractor tells me they cannot or will not use our version control system though, we have a problem and usually we end the relationship then and there. It may sound like a hardline call based on a single criteria but it is a deal breaker for me.

For a contractor there could of course be some concern that they've submitted the work and may not be paid. Version control is not the cause of this - it's dishonesty, plain and simple and if the person you're working for is that dishonest&nbsp;submitting&nbsp;code via email before the cheque clears is equally risky. &nbsp;
<h1>Some ground rules</h1>
Our most basic rule is commit at least once a day while you're working on the project. This is especially the case if the work is being done on a day rate, but also if the project was quoted on a fixed rate basis. We use the data to judge if a project is on time, we're completely upfront about why we want this: <strong>Knowing the current velocity for changes gives us a really good indication of where we are in the development cycle</strong>. With a current version committed to our repository we can just checkout, deploy and see. It removes the chances of miscommunication, misunderstandings and estimate errors. 

Committing early and often by contractors is much like releasing early and often to users. It allows us to make regular builds and run QA on the project. The benefits of this are that we can start to run our testing regime long before we would otherwise be able to test. We try to encourage external developers to follow similar methodologies to those we use internally, the primary goal of any new project is to make a deployable release as quick as possible, then add features to it in a sensible manner. This coupled with regular commits allows us to test features as they're added, not weeks down the line days or hours before the project is to go live.
<h2>Once bitten, twice shy</h2>
We've had a few projects in the past where we outside contractors for a variety of reasons failed to deliver on time. This has lead to our losing a follow up contract on at least one occasion we're aware of. By getting code committed to our repository we can see where a project is, and if&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;step in early with concerns about the deadline. 

Both daily commits and QA help immensely with this and all but eliminate estimate errors because we can have an honest objective conversation about how far we're going to miss milestones very early in the process because a miss becomes obvious when you can see the velocity. The earlier you can do this, the better your chance delivering on time.  
<h1>Rules for some, but not others</h1>
Sometimes it doesn't make sense to go the whole forcing version control down someone's throat route. For some projects and changes we'll just bang a few files into an zip archive, email it and get the same back, then integrate it ourselves. It usually depends on the scope of the changes and how long they're likely to be working on the project in question. We would only work with someone familiar or willing to learn version control though, even in the above scenario they'd would have to be willing to use it if we'd asked them to.

<strong>How have your experiences using version control with contractors gone? Post a comment and tell us about it!</strong>

<em>I think tomorrow I'll post a bit of more hands on article on setting up version control for contractors. I'll try to focus a little more on how to build, install and implement subversion with access controls. See you then.</em>

		    You may notice that this site has yet another new design today. I've left blogger and gone back to wordpress and hosted the blog. I like Blogger and I really like the idea of hosted applications but it just wasn't giving me the control I wanted and I was finding it&nbsp;time consuming&nbsp;to get things the way I wanted.&nbsp;
<h1>It's not you, it's me.</h1>
Hosted applications are great and Blogger has got to be one of the best free ones out there. I really do like it, but we wanted to make all our goroam pages consistent, so we bought the great <a href="http://diythemes.com/thesis/">thesis theme from diythemes</a>. We bought a developer licence so we could use it on all our sites and would be free to modify it.&nbsp;

I wanted something with a little more space for this blog, I liked running things down the side but it was getting too long and I had no space for anything else. For <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a> and <a href="http://citrusapp.com">citrus</a> I wanted to get something that would combine both the info at the top and blogs towards the bottom. Again in the next week or two we'l hopefully get there with this new theme.
<h1>is this the last change?</h1>
Honestly, no. I'll probably change a whole load of things over the coming weeks to try and&nbsp;differentiate&nbsp;the sites. Mostly I think I just like to change things.

				<a class="post-link" href="/2008/07/18/there-is-no-excuse-for-back-buttons-that-don-t-work/">There Is No Excuse for... Back Buttons That Don't Work</a> 			
				<small class="pull-right">Jul 18, 2008</small>
	        </h1>
        </div>
		<div class="content">
		    <p>The back button is one of the strongest and most pervasive conventions available to developers, yet some fail to use it correctly and see it as a burden rather than a resource. The fact of the matter is all users great and small know it's there. From novice to expert they quickly learn to know and use the back button and taking that away from them in your application, well there is no excuse for it. </p>

<p>The back button has become a usability must by convention; no matter how obvious your navigation is if the user clicks and link on your homepage then wants to go back they are more likely to use the back button than to click a navigation element labelled home, your logo or any of the other ways to get to your home page. </p>

<h1>Security, or something</h1>

<p>A big offender here is online banking, my back button is always throwing me errors - or worse I don't even get the address bar and navigation stuff. I'm stuck in their little application and have to use it as they dictate. I've heard arguments that this is to make applications more secure. Unfortunately the rhetoric is just that, hot air  Not letting me do something useful doesn't make an application more secure, it just means I'm inconvenienced. Most of the time these applications let me right click and use the context menus to go back anyway- so what's the point? </p>

<p>If your security model depends on hiding or not letting me do something useful, you have more serious problems than a back button.</p>

<h1>But back doesn't make sense, the process has completed</h1>

<p>The back button shouldn't always just show you the previous page. For example if the process is an order, of course it doesn't make sense to allow a user to step back into the ordering process and change details. Show them a page that tells them the order is completed, the details and provide useful links to modify the order - chances are if they've clicked back they want to change something. If not they'll just keep clicking back till they get where they want to be. </p>

<p>Which brings us to our next problem... </p>

<h1>Why do I have to hammer the back button to get back and skip some redirect page?</h1>

<p>I really hate sites that make me do this and the worst thing is, the back button is normally completely functional otherwise. Make sure if you're using redirects that they're not chained so that back button use is forcing users to click it a few times to get over a hump in the process. </p>

<h1>I give my users a link to use</h1>

<p>Not nearly good enough. You're in fact acknowledging a problem exists and providing a workaround, but your work around flies in the face of convention and forces users to think - usually after they've tried the back button on autopilot and things didn't work out. </p>

<h1>That's just lazy</h1>

<p>It all comes down to developer laziness I'm afraid. There is no reason to break the back button it's a navigation convention all sites should encourage by default and it should always just work. </p>

        </div>
		<div class="content">
		    <p>Re-reading my post about <a href="http://andrewmccall.com/2008/06/saying-no.html">saying no</a> got me thinking about the other reasons we've turned down work. It's hard getting work in the first place and doubly hard turning it down, but sometimes you just have to say no.</p>

<p> One big one that comes to mind is we quoted to do some work for a company we've had a long term working relationship with. A small company, they were unfortunately facing the loss of a key member of staff in the final few months of development of a key project already well overdue. A update to a project we'd worked with before, so we were familiar with the architecture, team and almost every aspect of the project.</p>

<p>We made quoted a day rate at the low end of the scale and offered to agree fixed times for each bit of development, insulating them from any estimate errors by delivering that iteration for the quoted price before undertaking the next. We agreed to put the work we were quoting on first, push our own development schedule back, not take on other work and offer any time the needed to get their project released.</p>

<p>I got the very distinct impression they wanted the work done cheap from a discussion with the technical lead for the project. I tried to mitigate any problems by sending an email detailing our costs and how they break down from developers salaries, equipment costs and the meagre profit margins. I also made it clear that we were uniquely qualified for the work, due to our extensive working history directly with the project.</p>

<p>The response was disappointing, they were willing to pay about half the rate we quoted. I had a brief discussion with the technical lead, who was as disappointed as us with the reaction, but it was clear there was going to be no middle ground. The offer was never even going to come up enough.</p>

<p>We gave up in the end - a shame really, like any small business we could have used the money. It was an issue of value. Despite all the positives, the experience, the fact that there was nobody else who could have hit the ground running like us and our prior working relationships they weren't willing to pay what we consider a very reasonable price. They effectively wanted work done for less cost to them than it would have cost to hire a member of staff, with none of the security or benefits. A short term contract under terms worse that a job I'd been offered months prior. </p>

<p>In the end they had to give the member of staff who had planned to leave a significant pay rise to entice them to stay, hired another, less experienced developer who needed more managing and training and still haven't delivered the project, months later. </p>

<p>For us, and for anyone else considering taking work at less than a market rate, it's a tough choice. Though we could afford to survive without the work, it would have been nice to have the money in the bank. There is also always the potential that work can lead to more work, however do you want cut rate work leading to more of the same? It's all too easy for it to set the tone of a working relationship and an expectation that you will continue to work for the low rate. Also the whole time you're servicing the contract you're not getting new clients or doing other more lucrative work. As a consultant if you're not saving for a raining day you're taking a huge risk, especially if things get a bit lean for a few weeks or months.</p>
