I recently read the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lentczner-rhttp-00">IETF draft RFC for Reverse HTTP</a>, and it looks like a pretty simple and elegant solution to a number of problems I've seen, especially with the move to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" class="zem_slink" title="Cloud computing" rel="wikipedia">cloud computing</a>.

<h2><strong>Virgin Media</strong></h2>
Last year when we moved home we moved out of a cable area, generally being happy with Virgin Media though and not wanting to pay the early termination fee we opted to go with their ADSL service. Of course these things never go smoothly and we had to have the ADSL line already here terminated, a new account created when that&nbsp;happened&nbsp;and it was all going to take a few weeks.

		    Increasing prices, obviously, can help your bottom line - as long as you don't&nbsp;alienate&nbsp;you users in the process by increasing them too much. But what if you're running a fremium model, free&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;for users hoping that the features of a paid for account are inticing enough that they'll give you money, and it becomes too expensive to service them. Can you get away with moving to a paid only model&gt;

		    Andrew Hyde posted "<a href="http://andrewhyde.net/a-message-to-twitter-spammers/">A Message to Twitter Spammers</a>" suggesting that something needed to be done, but does it really? In my comments to his post I asked if it was really&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;for Twitter to go that far, and weather it was really a problem at all.&nbsp;
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I'm not sure they need to go so far as to ban users that do it. As twitter grows communities are going to form around the speakers that have the most to offer. If the people mass following then unfollowing have nothing to say eventually their followers are going to move on.</blockquote>
The problem I have with wanting Twitter to do something about this is that it seems to me to be an argument by people who feel like they've earned their following against people they feel haven't. An argument you could interpret at elitst and at it's most base level it's just users upset that they're now having to deal with their&nbsp;

		    We launched the crawler a while ago now and the results are impressive and even a little surprising in some respects, while in others they're not. Basically we're happy we found a few thousand pages with geotags on the first crawl though the longer we've let it go the lower the ratio gets. Totally expected because we seeded it with pages we knew were geotagged in the first place.&nbsp;

		    A large part of the assumptions we're making with goroam are based around the idea that local business wants to capitalise on the Internet to bring in business. But it's not easy. How do promote a book store, toy shop, cafe or plumber in your local area online, now imagine you have a books and toys to sell, coffees and tea to make or houses without hot water to help - in short, a full time job that doesn't leave much time for SEO, SEM, analytics and tweaking a website and search advertising strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;
