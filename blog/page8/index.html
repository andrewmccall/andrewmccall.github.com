		    I'm going to need to act with a little more purpose in the new year, I've been at the crossroads for a number of weeks and been distracted. Job loss, Christmas and all the fall out of the two kind of had me standing still. I wasn't actually standing still, but I wasn't anywhere near as productive as I should have been or as I'm used to being. Other things just got in they way, not the least of which was my the&nbsp;pursuit&nbsp;of more than just "see-ya, best of luck!" from my previous employer; an ongoing process, but now out of my hands so I can refocus on what is actually important. &nbsp;

As a family we're in a position to stave off the wolves until at least March. It won't be&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;the most comfortable standard of living, but we won't have to move and we certainly wont starve - we'll just have to cut out some luxuries. I'm actively looking for any bits of work we might get to quote for in the new year.

I'm also&nbsp;polishing&nbsp;up my CV over the holidays and I'll be sending that out anywhere that looks like a good opportunity. I'm not sure how easy it's going to be to replace the 2 1/2 days a week I worked for my previous employer though. So full time offers might be a tough call, and they'd depend on the progress we're making with <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a> and the position and the opportunity it offers. I wouldn't expect a prospective employer &nbsp;to back me any less than 100%, so I couldn't in good faith take a job unless I could give them the same.&nbsp;

In the meantime I'm working on <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam's</a> newest project. A local search and exploration application, we've been working on the goals for a few months now (as I said above, I've been a bit distracted, so it's been a lot of talk), and I think we've got a pretty good idea of where we're going. I've enlisted the help of a friend a fellow coder to give me a hand getting it out the door with some evening and weekend work in his spare time. I've finished most of the user management stuff and started&nbsp;wireframimg&nbsp;up the core pages and they're really coming together well. &nbsp;I think I'm going to start posting details as they emerge and we'll be running an open beta as soon as enough features come together for a release.&nbsp;

Basically I'm doing everything I can to make sure I don't run out of money in the new year, and everything I can to protect myself against the loss of earnings from loosing the major part of my income. If anyone out there knows of any work going, drop me a line: andrew[dot]mccall[at]goraom[dot]net - we do bespoke coding,&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;and web projects in a number of languages from <a href="http://php.net/" class="zem_slink" title="PHP" rel="homepage">PHP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages" class="zem_slink" title="Active Server Pages" rel="wikipedia">ASP</a> to <a href="http://java.sun.com" class="zem_slink" title="Java (programming language)" rel="homepage">Java</a>.&nbsp;

		    I had an interesting chat with a friend today about what it means to be almost profitable and businesses that are perpetually stuck, with profitability just out of reach. It seems to be a problem that some companies never manage to get away from. 

The problem is I've seen a lot of companies where almost profitable is the status quo, sometimes for years.  I've seen these companies increase staff, sales and turn over but still profitability is just out of reach because costs also go up. For them the only way out is to change something fundamental.

In times like these the first reaction is to restructure the business and let staff go, but this can backfire - lower the number of sales staff and you'll likely cut your turnover, cut support staff and your customers might suffer directly, cut technical staff and can you keep up with the risk takers? 

Unfortunately some of the businesses, and the ones I'm talking about need a more radical change. And something that fundamental can be difficult to swallow because it often involves someone admitting they were wrong. A very difficult conversation when you've been selling everyone jam tomorrow. 

Hopefully some of the people in this position realise that, as other commenters are pointing out, now is possibly one of the best times to take risks. if you could change anything about your company, what would it be?<h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">

		    In case you haven't heard, didn't know or are just joining me - 

I used to work 2 1/2 days a week as an employee writing code for another company and the rest working for goroam. The problem was always that I had to put my job first and goroam second- obviously, since one paid and the other didn't. That was up until this weekend, when I got a letter telling me I had don't have a job anymore. 

So I've got a stark choice the wrong side of this close to Christmas, work hard to turn out the product we've been building for the last couple of months, get investment and make something truly great of it. Or get a job. 

You hear plenty of confident statements about downturns being the right time to start great companies, all the successful ones that began when it was logically wrong. To actually have to make the choice is a difficult position.

I wonder how it will work out, anyone with a comment either way - leave a comment! <h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">

I just want to go back and touch on the point I made at the end of that post and highlight it a bit. 

<strong>when I'm out there the data I want most is about out there</strong>

When I'm sitting somewhere waiting for someone I use my phone to check on any any feeds I'm following or to read my email, but I want so much more than that. The fact of the matter is location does matter, because but more often than not I want to know more than just where my nearest coffee shop or bar is; and I want to know more than just how to get there. I want the depth of information I can find on the internet, but I want to see it on a map and I want to see it relative to where I am. 

I want more than is on offer right now with location based services. I want to be able to pull a richer set of information off the Internet and overlay it on a map. I'm not entirely sure what that richer set of data is, or how to display it - I just know it's not what is out there now. It's not just a glorified business directory, it's not just directions to somewhere and it's not just a simple news mashup. 

Watch this space. ;)

		    I've been faced with a bit of a problem lately, how to test the quality of results being produced from a changing dataset? It's easy to write unit tests for components of an application, and to make sure they're producing the expected results, but how do you test end to end? 

Andraz from <a href="http://www.zemanta.com" title="Zemanta" class="zem_slink" rel="homepage">Zemanta</a> asking the same question, <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/blog/quality-assurance/">How do you test a complex system that is trying to mimic being smart,</a> last year.

<blockquote>when you have new content in the system, you get completely new related stories and you have to go back and have a human judge them. There is expansion of the evaluation data - as you add new tests you generally can&rsquo;t send them through previous versions of your algorithms, since that would be prohibitely expansive. And there is statistics that hardly gives you overview over what exactly your changes caused, just few final numbers. And then there is the problem of pipelining the processing. Even if you improve the first stage, end results might be worse, since you&rsquo;ve already adapted the second stage to previous first one. So you need to actually evaluate each part of the system in isolation and then together.

At the end you actually find out that you spend disproportional amount of time evaluating even the smallest changes. So you are in danger to just skip that evaluation which naturally you shouldn&rsquo;t.
</blockquote>

The fundamental problem you run up against is that the index is constantly changing, and it's meant to change. So it's hard to automatically test the output without a clear idea of what is going in. It's also difficult to get an accurate picture of how small changes in code affect the general results if you're just using a testing index with a small dataset.

One way to go about it is to gauge result quality based on measuring user interaction. Basically there are things users do when they get results they're expecting and things they do when they haven't found what they were looking for. So if you can get measure how they're reacting, you can get an idea of quality. 

At the moment I'm a lone developer putting all the data in the index, and I have a good idea of what I should be seeing out if it's actually working. In the next while though we're going to be rolling out to a few more internal beta users as we get a prototype system developed and we're not going to be in control of the inputs or output anymore. So soon enough we're going to actually be faced with trying to measure the quality of the results we're giving users in a dynamic system - expect to hear much more about this as we go on.

		    It's very, very hard for us to admit that we're wrong, let alone that we have no clue what we're doing. The first step of course is being able to admit that you've got a problem and before you can admit you have a problem you need to be able to recognise that you've got one. 

I came to the shocking realisation the other day, that I was guilty of not really know what I was doing. I came across a subtle bug in some of my code; my unit tests were passing but in production things weren't working as I expected. I dug deeper and got a vague idea of what was happening, then I engaged in <strong>shotgun programing</strong>. 

I knew I was doing it too. I had no idea what I was doing, and I knew it. I just started hacking away at my code, solving one problem and introducing another. Basically I knew where the problem was and as if it were some small animal rustling in the bushes nearby I just blasted away its general direction and just hoped I hit it, whatever it was. 

I eventually solved the problem, and eventually understood what was going on; but it was touch and go there for a while. The problem wasn't so much my trial and error approach, that did eventually solve the problem. It was more that I had no idea why I was trying the solutions I was trying, more specifically why I thought they were plausible I was just pointing in the general direction of the problem and letting loose. <h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">

		<div class="content">
		    I've been working form home for quite some time now, in the beginning I lived alone and I worked from home a few days a week. Working the balance in an office with real people. I found I was far more productive when I was in an home than in an office, mostly let's face it, because people had to pick up the phone to interrupt me. 

Recently things have changed, my partner had a little baby girl and we've moved. The house is bigger and I now have a room which I use almost exclusively as my office, which is a good thing because previously I've been working from a series of one bedroom flats and that just wouldn't work now.

<h1>Headphones and a door that closes</h1>

I have both and think they're infinitely important. My daughter is very young but between myself and Becca there is the policy that if the door is closed I'm busy. Unless someone is bleeding to death I don't want to know- we treat the closed door much like we'd treat it if I was working in an office half an hours commute away, if it wouldn't be important enough to call me away from work in the car, then it's not important enough to call me away from work here.

Sometimes, even with the door closed there can be a fair bit of noise and things to distract me, I have a good pair of headphones which acoustically seal me off from the rest of the world.  

<h1>Working Hours</h1>

I try to keep my working hours 9-5, just as I would with any job. Mostly because that's when everyone else is working and if I need to talk to someone, or if they need to talk to me they're most likely to try. I'm pretty flexible about it though and unless I need to deliver something I'll sometimes take a few hours off during the day to do the dishes, go do the recycling (everyone else goes on the weekend, but it's almost always quiet weekday mornings) or just spend some time with my daughter to give my partner a break. I make the time up evenings and weekends, but for the most part you'll find me adhering to the same schedule as the rest of the world - I just get to stay in bed while the rest of you commute. 

<h1>Works for me</h1>

Working from home works well for me, it takes discipline but to be honest it's not as hard as some people would like to make you think. Also for those bosses out there that don't trust staff to work from home - if you can't trust them not to bunk off at home, you probably can't trust them not to bunk off in the office either. <h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">

		    I've seen a lot of posts recently about how to go about hiring hackers. Well not just recently, it seems to be common thing people ask, because it's one of the hardest things to do. You're using an interview, or even a series of interviews to try your best to determine if the person is going to be up to the task. 

The problem is of course, you're really just determining if the person interviews well, or if they're the graduates that they've got good marks. The real problem is of course neither of the two matter because neither of them have much if any bearing on how good a coder a candidate is going to be. 

The problem is exacerbated in a startup because unlike some of the more successful bigger players you really can't afford to take people on a trial basis for 6 months. What can a startup do? 

There are a lot of universities that run placement programs for their students, programs allowing them to get real industry work experience. I've also worked in companies that made it a policy to hire students for internships then offer the best jobs once they've graduated. It was a great way to get talent. 

What if you need to hire to fill a more senior role, or you're not hiring at the right time of year? Student internships usually start once at the same time every year so unless you're looking for fill a role then, you're shit out of luck. 

I've toyed with the idea of a 'hacker camp', getting all the candidates together, and paying them to work as consultants on a project - then hiring the best into permanent positions. All the candidates need to be free to work on the project, and a lot of people would be pretty scared to leave a job to take part and some jobs would prevent them from working on the project, so running it over a weekend might be a good idea, but it limits the scope of your project. You'd also still need to have interviews, to make sure you were getting candidates who were really interested in the job, and also to weed out any candidates you knew were totally unsuitable. 

I think it's important that a 'hacker camp' should produce something at the end of the weekend and you should get as much of your existing staff involved as possible. To make the cost easier to swallow you could even go so far as making the deliverable a new feature or part of your existing product but that's not as important as actually delivering something, because that will be the bottom line when it comes to integrating them into your team.<h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">

		    I'm starting to get lots of messages about people following me, they've got one post and it's a link to "check them out" lots of new pics added. 

I've been blocking them as they show up, because I only have a few followers. I wonder how the popular people, who must be getting thousands of these cope?

Fucking spam, it's got to try to ruin every good thing.

As I've <a href="http://andrewmccall.com/2008/09/a-change-of-direction/">announced here</a>, we've recently taken the difficult decision to put development of Citrus in hold, indefinitely (let's be realistic, probably forever). I'm now wondering what if anything we should announce about our new project. 

Is openness a strength or a weakness? Is there value to the community in publicly documenting our design decisions, and how we've come to them? Is it something our competitors could and would use against us? Is there anyway to mitigate the effects? 

I like what <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com">Jeff Atwood</a> and <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> have done with their series of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/category/podcasts/">podcasts</a> on the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow blog</a> where they've released their design meetings as a series of podcasts and given us all an insight into how they've come to some of the decisions they've taken. But let's face it I'm neither Jeff or Joel and I don't get anywhere near their traffic. So the first obvious question I'm asking myself is if it's even worth the effort of writing posts, let alone recording and releasing podcasts. 

Next is the question about maintaining a competitive advantage, given the fact that our team is so small, just the two of us at the moment; I'm only working about half time on the project and Simon, who isn't a coder is working even less. So giving someone a guide to competing with us could be downright foolish. Then again, nobody is really listening are they? So does it even matter? 

The other question, which I think is equally important as the project grows - hopefully into a product is what if any level of openness is appropriate post launch? Will an open discussion of ongoing design decisions as they're being taken before, or even as they're released be of any benefit to the community? Communities can be some of the biggest supporters and can be some of your most passionate users - sometimes these passions can work both ways? What level of support ongoing will a public discussion of the decisions you're taking, before users have all the prototyped interfaces to play with, be required? Is there an ongoing effort you'll need to make to maintain the level of trust and confidence of the community? 

I think I've talked myself out of a podcast of our internal discussions, for now - but I'm still keen to use community interaction to help us develop a product that meets the needs of the people who are interested in using it and to drum up support and interest in the project. I'll no doubt return to this topic in the coming weeks as I develop a clearer idea of how I think we should accomplish that. 

If any of the few of you out there listening have any questions or comments, please let me know your thoughts.<h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">
