		    I use the <a href="http://diythemes.com?a_aid=andrewmccall">thesis</a> theme, we bought a developer licence a few months ago and I've used it as the basis for a few websites including this one and the goroam site. One thing I've been meaning to do with both was to start to move them away from the default thesis theme - not because the them is bad, in anyway just so this isn't just another default thesis blog.

		    I'm going to need to act with a little more purpose in the new year, I've been at the crossroads for a number of weeks and been distracted. Job loss, Christmas and all the fall out of the two kind of had me standing still. I wasn't actually standing still, but I wasn't anywhere near as productive as I should have been or as I'm used to being. Other things just got in they way, not the least of which was my the&nbsp;pursuit&nbsp;of more than just "see-ya, best of luck!" from my previous employer; an ongoing process, but now out of my hands so I can refocus on what is actually important. &nbsp;

		    I've been faced with a bit of a problem lately, how to test the quality of results being produced from a changing dataset? It's easy to write unit tests for components of an application, and to make sure they're producing the expected results, but how do you test end to end?

		    It's very, very hard for us to admit that we're wrong, let alone that we have no clue what we're doing. The first step of course is being able to admit that you've got a problem and before you can admit you have a problem you need to be able to recognise that you've got one.

		    I've been working form home for quite some time now, in the beginning I lived alone and I worked from home a few days a week. Working the balance in an office with real people. I found I was far more productive when I was in an home than in an office, mostly let's face it, because people had to pick up the phone to interrupt me.

		    I've seen a lot of posts recently about how to go about hiring hackers. Well not just recently, it seems to be common thing people ask, because it's one of the hardest things to do. You're using an interview, or even a series of interviews to try your best to determine if the person is going to be up to the task.
