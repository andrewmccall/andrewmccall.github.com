		    The great thing about the cloud is the extremely low barrier to entry. It's very cheap to get up and running, it's very cheap to scale and it's very cheap to store data.  I'm still not fully convinced that from a long term perspective with thousands of nodes it's going to be cheaper than provisioning your own servers and hosting but I'm more than happy to be convinced - saving money one way or another can't be a bad thing.

		    Sproozi generates a lot of data and when we launch we're going to be generating a lot more. Some of it overt and displayed on the website for all to see. Some of it in a database somewhere. Things like searches, locations, session information and clicks on outbound links. Some of that information could lead back to the people that are searching for it. It's happened <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/06/aol-proudly-releases-massive-amounts-of-user-search-data/">before</a> to other sites, even after they'd thought they took steps to protect users.

		    I've run into a few problems with some of the web apps I've been building lately as I'm sure others have. The explosion of the cloud is only going to lead more and more people down the exact same path. Let me just briefly explain the architecture which will help you understand why it's a problem.

		    My partner is mid way through her pregnancy, we're expecting number two, so within the next year I'm going to need to find somewhere else to work. Even if we end up with two girls and they can share a room, I'm just not not sure it's going to be practical to work from home with two young children. Even with just one I've been finding myself in the library more and more for the piece and quiet. Which got me to thinking about coworking and reaching out to see if there is anything in town or any interest in setting something up.
