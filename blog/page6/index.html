		    <em>I didn't get this posted yesterday because the Internet crapped out in our area. Nothing but excuses, I know.</em>

I've been working beyond the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge" class="zem_slink" title="Bleeding edge" rel="wikipedia">bleeding edge</a>, using a version of the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/" class="zem_slink" title="Nutch" rel="homepage">Nutch</a> code that's not even made it into the Apache SVN for the project yet. To celebrate the fact that my contributions will make it in I figure its a good time to get into <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Open_Source" class="zem_slink" title="Open Source" rel="wikinvest">open source</a> and business. 

To put it briefly, and as you can probably guess, I'm pro open source. I use it extensively and I push back as much as I can. When it comes to the most of the code I write there really isn't much commercial benefit in keeping it hidden so it just makes sense to give back.

There are two types of business on the web, one where you provide a software service and that is the product and others where you provide access to data. It's pretty easy to tell which camp you're in. 

<a href="http://37signals.com/" class="zem_slink" title="37signals" rel="homepage">37 Signals</a> for example, they're in the first and their software probably isn't something they just want to let people download - unless they're incredibly brave. Doing that would mean that they'd be competing on margins for the cheapest hosting, users would flock to the cheaper services, have a poor experience and blame the software. 

Sproozi on the other hand is the second type, our data is what users mostly care about and we're not planning to be precious about our code. I've already been pushing some of the changes I've made to Nutch back into the project and we're planning open source projects of our own in the coming months. 

One of our plans we have is to build <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" class="zem_slink" title="iPhone" rel="homepage">iPhone</a>, Andriod and other phone based applications for our service and release them as open source projects. We're planning to write them (or have them written for us) and release 'official' versions. Then release that code as open source project to provide a framework for developers so that they can build great things from it and on our API. 

If there are any experienced iPhone, <a href="http://code.google.com/android/" class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage">Android</a>, Blackberry, <a href="http://www.symbian.com" class="zem_slink" title="Symbian OS" rel="homepage">Symbian</a> or Pre developers out there that want to get involved, drop me a line were a ways off yet but would love to chat about it and get some very early feedback. <h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">

		    As some of you know already one day, real soon,  we're going to get around to relaunching goroam. We're still doing most of the same consulting work we've been doing for a while but we want to focus the site and face of the company more on what we actually do. 

We're not web-designers, we're not an advertising agency -  We develop and research social strategies and products to improve engagement. 

It sounds like a lot of marketing and buzz word bullshit but it boils down to the fact that people, companies and brands are realising that the web is so much more than a multimedia brochure. The simplistic metaphor you hear all the time is that it's a conversation, it's true. It's just like a conversation. You have to give and take and you have to speak in a way that doesn't make someone just want to walk away and avoid you in the future. Talking at someone doesn't work in real life and it's becoming less and less effective on the Internet. 

I saw an interesting presentation by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattseward">@mattseward</a> from <a href="http://kilo75.com/">Kilo75</a> last weekend about conversations with customers and more generally how they try to develop relationships between brands and their customers. One of the questions that came out of the audience was whether people wanted to have conversations with all these brands. It's a good question, but one that I think is slightly wide of the mark. 

The thing is what most brands have to say isn't terribly interesting to me, so I'm just not listening. Some though have a message which I find engaging and I do listen. <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37 Signals</a> is a good example - I use their products, I read their blog and I agree with their message and even pass it on. 

How do you use the Internet to improve engagement? What tools work best and how do you use them? Get in touch, I'll have more to say on this soon as we get closer and actually relaunch. 

I did it again! I wrote this on the day I wanted to publish is, then just left it as a draft. I need to try harder, it's only <a href="http://andrewmccall.com/2009/06/a-post-a-day-for-the-month-of-june/">Day 7</a>!

		    We've submitted our 4IP application for sproozi, we finally decided that no matter how many hours, days or weeks we though about it and changed it, it was just changing- not getting better. So we sat down today and spent some time with it and sent it in. 

Was it perfect? No. Was it good enough? Yes, I think so. It might not get us funding, but we can take it and build on it and send it to anyone else that will listen. 

In the plan we said that we're going to have a functional tech demo live for 1st July - so 1st of July check it out, it should work.

		    One thing that occurred to me while I've been writing Sproozi is how tied to a mapping implementation I am and it's something I've been thinking of starting a project to abstract the details away so that I could swap implementations whenever I liked. 

A couple of things I wanted out of the API, the most important was to be able to do were switch from one implementation to another without loosing my markers or having to reload them. I really like that foot paths show up on the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a> maps. 

Then I came across <a href="http://mapstraction.com">mapstraction</a> - which looks very good. I'm checking it out to see if it meets my needs. I'll let you know.

		    The great thing about the cloud is the extremely low barrier to entry. It's very cheap to get up and running, it's very cheap to scale and it's very cheap to store data.  I'm still not fully convinced that from a long term perspective with thousands of nodes it's going to be cheaper than provisioning your own servers and hosting but I'm more than happy to be convinced - saving money one way or another can't be a bad thing. 

Long term though one thing businesses really need to be wary of is being tied to tightly to a platform. There is of course the issue of being tied to an API and not being able to choose a new provider, but this isn't really what concerns me - we use debian AMIs on EC2 with a full opensource stack top to bottom. I'm taking about the the issue of economic lock in. The massive scale and masses of data the cloud allows users to store could quickly lead a company to a very expensive decision when it chooses to or is forced into moving providers. 

Moving data in or out costs about $0.10/GB (a nice easy number to work with), let's pretend it's about the same for all other provider, so to shift your data from one to another is going to cost you $0.20/GB. That could quickly add up to a massive cost just to choose a new provider. 1TB will cost you over $200, 1 petabyte, which isn't going to be an unheard of amount of data in the next few years, is going to cost over a whopping $200,000! Just to move to a new provider. That's some kind of lock-in, probably a lot more than the cost of any new or changed APIs. Not to mention how long it's going to take to transfer that amount of data and the fact that you've already paid $100,000 to get it there! 

Before anyone starts, yes I'm aware you can send Amazon a big storage device and they'll put all your data on that and send it back to you. Then you could probably send that data to your new provider and they'd put it in the cloud for you- I won't get into how good a solution to the problem this is, because I haven't really thought it through nor do I have any idea what that sort of storage would cost and what sort of redundancy you'd want it to have to safely truck the thing around.

What I'm trying to get across is that an open stack you control is probably something you really want to own. And it's probably something you want to deploy across more than one provider for redundancy and your own   piece of mind. Just imagine if your cloud provider launches a competitive service, shuts down or for whatever reason decides not to service your account anymore. 

There are mitigation strategies you can apply to this. With sproozi for example we're holding a lot of data on the nodes so that we can work with it. A lot of this can be rebuilt and reacquired, so we don't need to truck all our data about. Saving the list of places submitted by users and that we've discovered is more than enough to re-crawl everything and rebuild all the indexes. This is just one example though and we're not saving things like images and other data critical for users, so we're likely the exception here not the rule. 

We run only on EC2 at the moment, but when we actually start getting more data we're going to spread it out across a few providers - just in case.

		    Sproozi generates a lot of data and when we launch we're going to be generating a lot more. Some of it overt and displayed on the website for all to see. Some of it in a database somewhere. Things like searches, locations, session information and clicks on outbound links. Some of that information could lead back to the people that are searching for it. It's happened <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/06/aol-proudly-releases-massive-amounts-of-user-search-data/">before</a> to other sites, even after they'd thought they took steps to protect users.

We're also not the only ones, it's pretty much par for the course in search and on the web. If you didn't know it before now, rest assured that every click you make on any major website of any significance is tracked - including if they can, that you clicked it. Also know that from that data they can learn an awful lot about you, if not even who you are. 

Which brings up an obvious question which many people rightly ask - If a company is concerned at all about privacy why in the would would they keep any of this data? Well, there are a few very good reasons first and foremost for us is realted to a previous post of mine about <a href="http://andrewmccall.com/2008/11/testing-for-search-result-quality/">Testing for Search Result Quality</a>. It boils down to a very real problem testing user interaction when the results the system produces for any given input change between submissions of the same input - by design. To measure how we're performing we need to measure the actual user behaviour as opposed to measuring what we spit back. Without collecting the data to measure how changes are improving (or worsening) user experience we're more or less releasing code and hoping it's better. Not exactly a professional, or analytical approach to take. 

On the other hand my privacy is important to me and it makes me uncomfortable to think about all the data I generate lying about the web. I'm not sure what makes me uncomfortable, but I also know it's not just me. I want to be in control of what other know about me. I feel like I need to treat everyone else's data with the same respect I want for mine.  

Let's face it, I don't want to keep personally identifiable data about anyone for any longer than I need to. After a while they become just a statistic anyway. So we're looking into what to do with the data and at which points we can start to anonymise  and filter the data to remove personally identifiable information, but we're starting the process from the beginning as opposed to the end - if we're keeping something, I want a reason to keep it. 

Some argue that data is the most valuable thing a business has in the modern world, but we tend to take a smaller, more pragmatic, more local view - we can build up a data set for some metric we want to start measuring, but we can never rebuild trust if we lose it. Plus what value will a click stream have in 2, 3, 6 or even 12 months time? So why bother collecting what we're not using? 

Some might ask, why bring this all up, before you've launched? Well partly because I've been thinking about it recently and partly because I think it's important to be upfront about the data we collect, what we use it for and what we'll do with it. I also think it's important to show that privacy isn't an afterthought, it's something we considered before we ever collected any data, and something we continue to not only consider as we develop, but that we take privacy of our users very seriously.

		    Once upon a time I tried to set myself the goal of a post a day forever - it was hard and I failed almost immediately. Forever, it turns out, is a long time. Days, weeks or months later I look back and think, this was supposed to be the future; Where are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_car_%28aircraft%29" class="zem_slink" title="Flying car (aircraft)" rel="wikipedia">flying cars</a>, the robots, my posts?

So I'm going to try an experiment. I'm going to write something here every day for the whole of June. I'm going to try to avoid writing the posts all in a day and scheduling them, because that's not writing something here everyday.

I've just been to <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLeeds2009">BarCamp Leeds 2009</a>, <a href="http://sproozi.com">sproozi</a> is coming along well, we're&nbsp;re-launching&nbsp;<a href="http://goroam.net">GoRoam</a> to focus more on consulting work we do and want to get more involved with, I'm getting involved setting up some coworking, open coffees and other things to try to get more involved and&nbsp;collaborate&nbsp;more with the local entrepreneurs and the digital community in Hebden&nbsp;Bridge; so really there isn't any excuse, I have enough to say to easily fill 30 days.

So, a post a day for the month of June - Day 1.

		    Spent this weekend at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLeeds2009">Bar Camp Leeds 2009</a>, it was great. There were some good presentations and talks and I really enjoyed getting out and talking to other people in the digital and creative industries.

I've been working from home now for a couple of years and it's sometimes easy to get caught up in a routine and to forget that part of things. It's easy, despite all the blogs and twitter messages we - or at least I, constantly read- to forget that there are people nearby doing very similar things. In the case of Hebden Bridge, quite a few.

Getting out there and meeting people has really hit home the idea that I would find a coworking space in Hebden Bridge&nbsp; immensely useful. I've been in touch with some of the people involved with the <a href="http://www.hebdenbridgetownhall.org.uk/">Town Hall</a> project and the whole idea for the creative quarter they've got planned looks great. It's probably a couple of years off though and what interests me most isn't the building; it's the community, collaboration and sharing of ideas.That's something that can start without any funding, so I've been wondering what can be accomplished in the meantime. &nbsp;Starting now also gives the Town Hall project the best social proof and traction for the concept possible.

So what's next? I'm going to try and organise an <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org/">open coffee</a>, try to guage interest in making it regular, <a href="http://coworking.pbworks.com/">coworking</a> and maybe even somewhere down the line try to start our own Hebden Bridge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp" class="zem_slink" title="BarCamp" rel="wikipedia">BarCamp</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" class="zem_slink" title="Unconference" rel="wikipedia">unconference</a>, with it's diverse make up I bet it would be something unique.

		    I've run into a few problems with some of the web apps I've been building lately as I'm sure others have. The explosion of the cloud is only going to lead more and more people down the exact same path. Let me just briefly explain the architecture which will help you understand why it's a problem.

Basically I have a site which is all too commonly static html, css, images and javascript. The magic all happens through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest" class="zem_slink" title="XMLHttpRequest" rel="wikipedia">XMLHttpRequest</a>.

Ideally what I want to be able to do is to push all this static stuff somewhere fast and as close to the user as possible. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront" class="zem_slink" title="Amazon CloudFront" rel="wikipedia">CloudFront</a> is an obvious choice, but then I get hit by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" class="zem_slink" title="Same origin policy" rel="wikipedia">same origin policy</a>. To work around the issue and because I want to publish the API for developers to use I've implemented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" class="zem_slink" title="JSON" rel="wikipedia">JSONP</a> callbacks.

Though I did come across the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" class="zem_slink" title="World Wide Web Consortium" rel="homepage">W3C</a> <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/access-control/%20">access control</a> work and noted that we may be close to a solution, at least for the newest browsers. That brought up a whole new question that's been plaguing web designers and developers for years - how old does a browser need to be before you take it out back and shoot it?

Look through browser market share and my tiny sample set I'm also seeing that browsers are more or less up to date. Which is great news. There are a few IE6 hold outs showing up my visitor stats but for the most part everyone appears to be more or less up to date. Has software update actually solved the issue, probably not by I for one, welcome any progress.

So that brings us to the real question, with the vast majority of the browsers out there running at or beyond the most current release do we need to care about those that don't? Do we even want to deal with the train wreck that is IE6 compatibility anymore?

		    My partner is mid way through her pregnancy, we're expecting number two, so within the next year I'm going to need to find somewhere else to work. Even if we end up with two girls and they can share a room, I'm just not not sure it's going to be practical to work from home with two young children. Even with just one I've been finding myself in the library more and more for the piece and quiet. Which got me to thinking about coworking and reaching out to see if there is anything in town or any interest in setting something up.

For a town of it's size <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebden_Bridge" class="zem_slink" title="Hebden Bridge" rel="wikipedia">Hebden Bridge</a> has a great artistic and creative community and more than it's fair share of creative professionals; creatives, technologists, artists, designers, writer, journalists and programmers like me. It's a great family town but a lot of the houses are fairly small. Perfect it would seem for a co-working setup. 

I've sent some emails and posted on the <a href="http://www.hebdenbridge.co.uk/forum/index.html">HebWeb forums</a> and so far there has been enough positive feedback that I'll pursue it some more.
