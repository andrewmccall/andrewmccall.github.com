Hi there! 👋

I'm Andrew (or Drew if you rather). I've been doing things with data and data
systems for quite some time.🤓

My earliest internet evidence are some commits to HBase and Nutch from 2008
when I was working on a location based search engine startup with a friend. It
failed, but was a lot of fun and started me off on my passion 💖 for
scalable distributed systems.🚀

I've been a developer professionally for almost 20 years 👴. In compaines and
teams of all sizes and tech stacks. Most recently I've been the Chief Engineer
on a team of Data Engineers in a large UK retail bank and the Head of Data
Engineering at a ride sharing startup.

All opinions and thoughts on this site are my own.🧐
