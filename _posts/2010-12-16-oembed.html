I came across&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oembed.com/">oEmbed</a>&nbsp;the other day, completely by accident. <p />I've been working on a couple of projects in my free time and in a few of them I really wanted to be able to embed better information about a URL, if it existed. I'd been working up my own rough JSON schema that was in many ways similar to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oembed.com/">oEmbed</a>.<p /><div>Then I came across a tweet that mentioned&nbsp;<a href="http://embed.ly">embed.ly</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oembed.com/">oEmbed</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://embed.ly">embed.ly</a>&nbsp;are the perfect solution. Instead of rolling my own service I'm integrating theirs.<br /></div><p /><div>At it's most basic it's a standard way of getting more than just a link you can embed in your site and provides a standard interface for doing it across the web.&nbsp;</div><p /><div>If you're looking to embed things in your website, take a look. There are plugins available for wordpress and others as well as a jQuery plugin you can use pretty much anywhere.&nbsp;</div>
