My weekend catchup reading list. 

<ul>
	<li>I'm re-reading <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a> 37 Signals's excellent online book. Essential reading for almost everyone, I just can't recommend it enough.</li>
	<li>About <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001171.html">cross site forgery attacks</a>, not as dangerous as XSS but pretty annoying for users when they're randomly logged out.</li>
     <li>
<a href="http://www.wordtracker.com/offers/kickass/">"50 Kick-Ass Keyword Strategies"</a> by Aaron Wall of <a href="http://www.seobook.com">SEOBook</a>
</li>
</ul>
