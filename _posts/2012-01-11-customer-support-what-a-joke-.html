title: Customer support, what a joke.

<div>Sainsbury's online grocery site was broken last night; it kept giving me 404 errors when I tried to pay for my order. There was one slot left that would get here before I had to pick the kids up, I'd booked it and wanted to keep it,&nbsp;&nbsp;so I emailed their customer support. I was hoping maybe they'd tell me when it would be fixed, reserve the slot for me or something.&nbsp;</div><p /><div>I kept checking my email and trying their site and eventually later in the evening it worked, so I forgot about the whole thing until this morning when I got this:&nbsp;<br /><p /><blockquote type="cite"><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><span style=""><b>From: </b></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">"Sainsbury's Online " &lt;<a href="mailto:sainsburys@mailuk.custhelp.com">sainsburys@mailuk.custhelp.com</a>&gt;<br /></span></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><span style=""><b>Subject: </b></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"><b>Shopping online [Reference: 120110-00XXXX]</b><br /></span></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><span style=""><b>Date: </b></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">11 January 2012 09:54:42 GMT<br /></span></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><span style=""><b>To: </b></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"><a href="mailto:andrew@andrewmccall.com">andrew@andrewmccall.com</a><br /></span></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><span style=""><b>Reply-To: </b></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">"Sainsbury's Online " &lt;<a href="mailto:sainsburys@mailuk.custhelp.com">sainsburys@mailuk.custhelp.com</a>&gt;<br /></span></div><br /><div style=""><div><p /><table border="0" style="" width="100%"><tr><td class="text" style="padding-left: 4px; padding-right: 4px;" colspan="2">Dear Mr McCall<p />Thank you for your email about our website.
