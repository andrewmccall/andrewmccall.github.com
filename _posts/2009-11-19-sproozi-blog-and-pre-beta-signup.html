Sproozi is getting closer to actually doing something that's worth showing off. I've setup a blog for it at <a href="http://blog.sproozi.com">blog.sproozi.com</a> where I'll post development updates. I've also added beta pre-registration to the <a href="http://sproozi.com">Sproozi</a> site. We're going to need testers as soon as it launches, so if you'd like to help out let me know over <a href="http://sproozi.com">there</a>.
