I added <a href="http://www.zemanta.com" title="Zemanta" class="zem_slink" rel="homepage">Zemanta</a> to the blog today at lunch time and so far I think it's great. I've gone through and quickly added a links to a few posts, I'm not going to go back and do many but I'm going to use it going forward. 

One of the most common pieces of advice you hear about blogging and getting noticed is to link. With Zemanta linking far and wide is a few simple clicks away. 

I have no vested interest in Zemanta - I know very little about them. I really just like what it does. <h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles by Zemanta</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul">
