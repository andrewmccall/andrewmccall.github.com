I realised that I'm not very good at this when I looked at my last commit for this theme. The message was "added a few things" a message I find myself using when I have nothing else to say, or if I've done too much work and either can't remember all of what I did or be bothered writing it all out.

It's bad form though, and I'm trying to learn my way into using git properly to make it happen less. Basically I'm still trying to find the right place between a commit for a unit of work and my previous more traditional view that all commits must compile and pass tests. At the same time I'm trying to reconcile that with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" class="zem_slink" title="Kanban" rel="wikipedia">Kanban</a> board way of organising what to do.

How does everyone else commit? When, how often and what 'rules' do you apply?
