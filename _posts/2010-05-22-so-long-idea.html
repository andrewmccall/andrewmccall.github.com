I've been using Intellij IDEA for years, I pretty much swear by it for development and I have no real complaints. But now I've got a new job and they use Eclipse. Now, so do I.&nbsp;I figure there is no way to properly learn to use Eclipse if my heart is still in IDEA, so there's nothing for it except to say goodbye IDEA and move over to Eclipse for everything.

Looking around the Eclipse ecosystem and there are an awful lot of what look to be excellent plugins. I know IDEA had a plugin system but the ecosystem never seemed as good and I never really got into them.

Now it's off to import my projects and see what's what. I did try this a few weeks ago after my interview, but gave up with the excuse that I wanted to get some work done.
