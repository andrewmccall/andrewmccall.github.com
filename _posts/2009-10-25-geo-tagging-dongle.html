Saw a truly awesome piece of kit on the engadget <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/25/phototrackr-mini-geotagging-device-shrinks-down-adds-mac-and-ra/">website</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gisteq.com/PhotoTrackr/PhotoTrackrDPL900.php">PhotoTrackr mini </a>from GiSTEQ. It's a little USB dongle that you carry around with you and it logs your route as you go. When you're done you plug it in and use the software to add geo data about where you were when you took the picture.

It's less than &pound;50 and what's best, it exports the logs as NEMA and GPX.
