As you can tell if you've been here before I finally got around to putting the new design I mostly put together 6 weeks ago when Bill was born, online&nbsp;- It's been a busy 6 weeks.

I've been focusing mostly on Sproozi and looking for some seed funding to try to get another developer on board and really get it off the ground. If you know someone who may be interested in investing in a local search and exploration application - let me know. If you know a Java/Hadoop/HBase developer that wants to work on an exciting new project (at least I think it is) - let me know.

Anyway, I hope you like the new look, it's basically one gigantic set of dynamic sidebars with widgets. The code is in github if you're interested: <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall/hemingway">http://github.com/andrewmccall/hemingway</a>.
