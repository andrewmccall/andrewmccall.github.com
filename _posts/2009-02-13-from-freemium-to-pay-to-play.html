Increasing prices, obviously, can help your bottom line - as long as you don't&nbsp;alienate&nbsp;you users in the process by increasing them too much. But what if you're running a fremium model, free&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;for users hoping that the features of a paid for account are inticing enough that they'll give you money, and it becomes too expensive to service them. Can you get away with moving to a paid only model&gt;

The move from 0 to even 0.01 is an infinite jump&nbsp;especially&nbsp;in the eyes of your users, if for no other reason than you're asking them to do something else; put in credit card details. So I think&nbsp;It's going to be interesting to watch Zoto who are <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/02/28/zoto/#">moving from a fremium model to one with only paid accounts</a> [via mashable]

I think they'll probably suffer short term, certainly in visitor numbers, but that does it really matter long term as long as they're&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;paying customers? Even if the number they're&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;on a monthly basis drops off those users aren't paying the costs of the freeloaders, so Zoto may actually be better off with lower levels.&nbsp;

Anyway, if I remember I'll probably check back and see how things go in a few months.
