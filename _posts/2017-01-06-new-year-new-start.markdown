I've had this domain and site for almost 10 years. I've never managed to
regularly post. So I've decided to clear it all out and start again. I'm not
going to promise a post a day, but I do want to post regularly. Twice a week
feels like a good cadence.

Let's see if I can get to 100 posts this year.
