We've submitted our 4IP application for sproozi, we finally decided that no matter how many hours, days or weeks we though about it and changed it, it was just changing- not getting better. So we sat down today and spent some time with it and sent it in. 

Was it perfect? No. Was it good enough? Yes, I think so. It might not get us funding, but we can take it and build on it and send it to anyone else that will listen. 

In the plan we said that we're going to have a functional tech demo live for 1st July - so 1st of July check it out, it should work.
