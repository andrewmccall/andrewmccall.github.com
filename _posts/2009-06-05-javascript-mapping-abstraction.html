One thing that occurred to me while I've been writing Sproozi is how tied to a mapping implementation I am and it's something I've been thinking of starting a project to abstract the details away so that I could swap implementations whenever I liked. 

A couple of things I wanted out of the API, the most important was to be able to do were switch from one implementation to another without loosing my markers or having to reload them. I really like that foot paths show up on the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a> maps. 

Then I came across <a href="http://mapstraction.com">mapstraction</a> - which looks very good. I'm checking it out to see if it meets my needs. I'll let you know.
