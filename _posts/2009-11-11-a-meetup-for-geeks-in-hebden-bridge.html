What:

We're holding a GeekUp style meet in Hebden Bridge, open to anyone who is a geeky about anything.

There is no formal agenda or presentations planned, we'll see how it goes, hope it works and if it does we can to turn it into a regular event.

Most established Geek Ups are primarily aimed at techie geeks - We'd like to see ours better represent the area and to be something unique. So we're throwing the door open to all geeks, if you're obsessive about something (tech, beer, music, films, books, knitting...), come along.
