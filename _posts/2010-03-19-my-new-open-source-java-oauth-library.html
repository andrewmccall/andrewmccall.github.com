title: My new open source Java OAuth library
published: true
---
I've just pushed out a new open source java OAuth library because I couldn't find one that did what I needed. My key requirement was simplicity. I didn't like the idea of using the library for HTTP stuff and there is no reason I should. Once I've obtained the Access Token all I'm doing with oAuth is signing my requests.

I want to use HttpClient directly and only use the oAuth library to sign the message for various reasons not the least of which being that I already have a HttpClient object setup in my IoC container.

The closest I found was <a href="http://github.com/kaeppler/signpost">signpost</a> but it wasn't very IoC friendly or thread-safe which meant every time I wanted to make a call I'd have to create new objects, or at the very least call a bunch of methods to set them up which highlights the third problem, there were no clear objects that I could store for later.

The library I've just release is a fork of the signpost code, that's now thread-safe and should be more IoC friendly. You create your method calls as you would normally, and just before you call <code>HttpClient.execute(HttpMethod)</code> simply call <code>OAuthConsumer.sign(HttpMethod, AccessToken);</code>.

I've added a few new objects that handle most of the work. Service, RequestToken and AccessToken are all beans that you pass to a consumer depending on what you want to do. Starting with a Service you call

<div class="CodeRay">
  <code>Service service = new Service();
service.setRequestTokenUrl(&quot;http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token&quot;);
service.setAccessTokenUrl(&quot;http://twitter.com/oauth/access_token&quot;);

service.setConsumerKey(&quot;b8sA385mBBNqOTD6Omlsw&quot;);
service.setSharedSecret(&quot;MD4Sve6AdaDasjdvOAsbpAJsA87S8s64e5rE4&quot;);

service.setMessageSigner(new PlainTextMessageSigner());
service.setSigningStrategy(new AuthorizationHeaderSigningStrategy());

RequestToken requestToken = oAuthConsumer.getRequestToken(twitter);</code>
</div>


You'll have to send the user off to twitter to check their credentials. When they come back
they'll be given a verifier set it and trade the request token for an access token
<div class="CodeRay">
  <code>requestToken.setVerifier(verifier):
AccessToken accessToken = oAuthConsumer.getAccessToken(requestToken);</code>
</div>

Now you can store the accessToken to use later, when you want to simply setup your http method as you would normally.   

<div class="CodeRay">
  <code>HttpUriRequest request...
// do your HttpClient stuff here

oAuthConsumer.sign(request, accessToken);
HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(request);</code>
</div>

There is also code in there for the Jetty HttpClient, but it's a bit rough and I haven't used it. Have  play with it and let me know what you think. 

UPDATE: Forgot to link to it... Dumb. <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall/oauth">It's on GitHub here</a>.
