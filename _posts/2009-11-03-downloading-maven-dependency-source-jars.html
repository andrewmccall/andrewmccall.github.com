title: Downloading maven dependency source jars
published: true

I've been working on a new project that I'm planning to <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Open_Source" class="zem_slink" title="Open Source" rel="wikinvest">open source</a> real soon - stay tuned.

When I'm implementing interfaces in a dependent package using Idea/<a href="http://maven.apache.org" class="zem_slink" title="Apache Maven" rel="homepage">Maven</a> I want to tick the "copy javadoc" button to at least have the documentation from the intereface. The issue of course is that I don't have the sources.

Run the following command:

<code>mvn dependency:sources</code>

Maven will download any sources it can find for in remote repositories for your dependencies and Idea finds them like magic. So now not only can you copy javadoc, you can also click the line number in the stack trace and get something meaningful - not "compiled code".
