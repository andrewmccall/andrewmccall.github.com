title: To follow or to nofollow...

Sorry if you came here wondering if you should <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow" class="zem_slink" title="Nofollow" rel="wikipedia">nofollow</a> comments or something else on your site or blog, but I'm looking at it more from a crawler's perspective. Though if that is why you're here you&nbsp;have something to add.

Basically the nofollow either in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element" class="zem_slink" title="Meta element" rel="wikipedia">meta tags</a> or as a rel attribute of an a tag is a hint to a crawler telling it, in it's most basic terms, not to follow the link.&nbsp;But what does that really mean to me, if I run the crawler? More importantly, how is it actually being used?&nbsp;

On blogs, personal websites and even wikipedia the nofollow policy is pretty clear and transparently aimed at preventing spam - and it works.

But how are they applied? Well,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-google-yahoo-askcom-treat-the-no-follow-link-attribute/4801/">not even the big search engines treat them consistently</a>: Google completely blanks them, Yahoo indexes them but adds no juice, and Ask doesn't even support them [Granted this article may be somewhat out of date].&nbsp;

One interesting thing that came out of the answers though, was the one from Google:&nbsp;
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">On a related note, though, and echoing Matt&rsquo;s earlier sentiments&hellip; we hope and expect that more and more sites &mdash; including Wikipedia &mdash; will adopt a less-absolute approach to no-follow&hellip; expiring no-follows, not applying no-follows to trusted contributors, and so on.</blockquote>
So within even Google, with the&nbsp;strictest&nbsp;application of a nofollow policy, there is certainly a strong argument and use case for treating this as a hint as opposed to a policy. I'm not even sure why Google needs wikipedia to make a policy change, everything they hope for could be implemented at their end.&nbsp;

A link on wikipeida, if it's been there long enough, probably deserves some juice. And that same logic applies to any site, even your blog - nofollow is a hint to a search engine. It's there to deter spam, but if a link sticks around then by not removing it, to a point, the site is endorsing it.&nbsp;

For our application we're working from a slightly different angle - there aren't a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging" class="zem_slink" title="Geotagging" rel="wikipedia">geotagged</a>&nbsp;urls and there isn't much span so at least&nbsp;initially&nbsp;we want as many as we can get. So we may not index or pass juice on to the site, at least initially, but we do want to follow the link.&nbsp;
