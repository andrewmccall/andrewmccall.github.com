I've been busy and haven't had a chance to get things posted like I wanted to. Work and personal commitments have a habit of getting in the way of otherwise good intentions. I'll do my best to get a few posts out this week and I'll see if I can't get caught back up and maybe get a few posts written and scheduled. 

It's been an eventful couple of weeks on a number of fronts - I wouldn't go so far as to say exciting because that would imply all good stuff. Some of it was good, some was bad - other parts just interesting. 

Hopefully we'll be able to push out some good news on the <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a> front in the next few weeks. Despite what our detractors may say or think we are working hard on getting things done - but stuff takes time. Especially when other commitments get in the way. 

In the meantime, where were we?
