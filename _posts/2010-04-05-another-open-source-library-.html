I'm having a bit of a clear out, taking a look at some of the code I've written and I've been pushing some of the stuff I'm currently using up to <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall">GitHub</a> under and Apache 2 licence. I've used things in <a href="http://announce.ly">Announce.ly</a>, <a href="http://sproozi.com">Sproozi</a> and some other small projects and figure they may be useful to someone else. My only criteria has been to ask If I'm using it now in a project, if so I'm actively supporting it and I've started pushing that stuff to <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall">GitHub</a>, everything else is dormant and I don't want to release something I'm not actively supporting- it also occurs to me that if even I'm not using it, it can't be all that worthwhile.

I've just pushed <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall/accounts">some code </a>I've been testing for a few months in a couple of projects to <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall">GitHub</a>. It's an accounts package written for <a href="http://springframework.org">Spring</a>, that ties my <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall/oauth">oAuth</a> library and <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> together with either <a href="http://hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> or <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase">Hbase</a> as backend storage. In it's simplest form when you login with twitter it creates you a new user and persists it and the oAuth access tokens you need to act on behalf of that user.

I'll write some more about it, better documentation and probably throw a little more code up on <a href="http://github.com/andrewmccall">GitHub</a> over the course of the next couple of weeks as and when I get a chance.
