title: Some more thoughts on coworking in Hebden Bridge
published: true
---
Spent this weekend at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLeeds2009">Bar Camp Leeds 2009</a>, it was great. There were some good presentations and talks and I really enjoyed getting out and talking to other people in the digital and creative industries.

I've been working from home now for a couple of years and it's sometimes easy to get caught up in a routine and to forget that part of things. It's easy, despite all the blogs and twitter messages we - or at least I, constantly read- to forget that there are people nearby doing very similar things. In the case of Hebden Bridge, quite a few.

Getting out there and meeting people has really hit home the idea that I would find a coworking space in Hebden Bridge&nbsp; immensely useful. I've been in touch with some of the people involved with the <a href="http://www.hebdenbridgetownhall.org.uk/">Town Hall</a> project and the whole idea for the creative quarter they've got planned looks great. It's probably a couple of years off though and what interests me most isn't the building; it's the community, collaboration and sharing of ideas.That's something that can start without any funding, so I've been wondering what can be accomplished in the meantime. &nbsp;Starting now also gives the Town Hall project the best social proof and traction for the concept possible.

So what's next? I'm going to try and organise an <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org/">open coffee</a>, try to guage interest in making it regular, <a href="http://coworking.pbworks.com/">coworking</a> and maybe even somewhere down the line try to start our own Hebden Bridge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp" class="zem_slink" title="BarCamp" rel="wikipedia">BarCamp</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" class="zem_slink" title="Unconference" rel="wikipedia">unconference</a>, with it's diverse make up I bet it would be something unique.
