I use the <a href="http://diythemes.com?a_aid=andrewmccall">thesis</a> theme, we bought a developer licence a few months ago and I've used it as the basis for a few websites including this one and the goroam site. One thing I've been meaning to do with both was to start to move them away from the default thesis theme - not because the them is bad, in anyway just so this isn't just another default thesis blog.

That's been the plan for the last 4 months. In the new year I'm going to actually make some of the changes.

One of the first things I want to do is start to put some of my own pictures in the rotating box. Ideally I'd love to have it pull from my public flickr stream (incidentally, something else on my resolutions list for the new year is to start using flickr more). After that I'd like to do something with the design to make it more&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;and more mine, lets see how it goes.
