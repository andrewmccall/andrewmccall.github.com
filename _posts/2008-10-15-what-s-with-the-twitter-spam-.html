I'm starting to get lots of messages about people following me, they've got one post and it's a link to "check them out" lots of new pics added. 

I've been blocking them as they show up, because I only have a few followers. I wonder how the popular people, who must be getting thousands of these cope?

Fucking spam, it's got to try to ruin every good thing.
