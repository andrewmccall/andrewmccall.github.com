Again, I'm here apologising for letting things slip a little. I've been busy and posting has unfortunately suffered for it. I've been working hard trying to get things moving for <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a>, and it's been time consuming. I basically spend the last half of last year bogged down with a project and had no time at all to spend on it, so for the last half of this year the focus is really to turn it around, launch a few things and start bringing some revenue in. 

Our biggest project at the moment is running an online marketing campaign for <a href="http://mediqol.com">Mediqol</a> a medical device consultancy. Our lofty goal is to show up in the first position for the search keywords <a href="http://mediqol.com">medical device</a>, short term we're just interested in optimising the adwords campaigns, and increasing organic traffic for the keywords we know work.

Then there is <a href="http://citrusapp.com">Citrus</a> - Work is progressing, but we might be looking at an end of the year launch for it. My gut feeling is that we won't be anything approaching a launch before the end of November.

In the meantime we're looking into a couple of smaller launches. I have a couple of ideas for tools and products that tie into the <a href="http://citrusapp.com">Citrus</a> roadmap that we can launch. 

I'm going to spend some time this afternoon and weekend writing some posts to get on top of it again.
