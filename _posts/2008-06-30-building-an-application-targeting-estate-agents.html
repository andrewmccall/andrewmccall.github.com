title: Building an application targeting estate agents
published: true

<p>By all accounts the property market is in free fall and we're taking the possibly bold decision to launch a product with estate agents as our primary market. </p><p>The product is called <a href="http://citrusapp.com">Citrus</a> and it's better way for agents to sell property online because frankly the existing solutions are all pretty lame. We got here through our work with a good friend Colin and his spanish property business <a href="http://www.spiritofgranada.com">Spirit of Granada</a>. In developing the website for his business we realised that the existing solutions weren't easy for a small company or sole trader to work with, they involved lengthy contract terms, high costs and confusing feature sets and options. We want to change all that and think that our insider knowledge of how these smaller agents operate will allow us to build an application for the market that doesn't suck. </p><p>Stay tuned to find out. </p>
