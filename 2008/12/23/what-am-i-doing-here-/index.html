  <article class="post-content">
  I'm going to need to act with a little more purpose in the new year, I've been at the crossroads for a number of weeks and been distracted. Job loss, Christmas and all the fall out of the two kind of had me standing still. I wasn't actually standing still, but I wasn't anywhere near as productive as I should have been or as I'm used to being. Other things just got in they way, not the least of which was my the&nbsp;pursuit&nbsp;of more than just "see-ya, best of luck!" from my previous employer; an ongoing process, but now out of my hands so I can refocus on what is actually important. &nbsp;

As a family we're in a position to stave off the wolves until at least March. It won't be&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;the most comfortable standard of living, but we won't have to move and we certainly wont starve - we'll just have to cut out some luxuries. I'm actively looking for any bits of work we might get to quote for in the new year.

I'm also&nbsp;polishing&nbsp;up my CV over the holidays and I'll be sending that out anywhere that looks like a good opportunity. I'm not sure how easy it's going to be to replace the 2 1/2 days a week I worked for my previous employer though. So full time offers might be a tough call, and they'd depend on the progress we're making with <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam</a> and the position and the opportunity it offers. I wouldn't expect a prospective employer &nbsp;to back me any less than 100%, so I couldn't in good faith take a job unless I could give them the same.&nbsp;

In the meantime I'm working on <a href="http://goroam.net">goroam's</a> newest project. A local search and exploration application, we've been working on the goals for a few months now (as I said above, I've been a bit distracted, so it's been a lot of talk), and I think we've got a pretty good idea of where we're going. I've enlisted the help of a friend a fellow coder to give me a hand getting it out the door with some evening and weekend work in his spare time. I've finished most of the user management stuff and started&nbsp;wireframimg&nbsp;up the core pages and they're really coming together well. &nbsp;I think I'm going to start posting details as they emerge and we'll be running an open beta as soon as enough features come together for a release.&nbsp;

Basically I'm doing everything I can to make sure I don't run out of money in the new year, and everything I can to protect myself against the loss of earnings from loosing the major part of my income. If anyone out there knows of any work going, drop me a line: andrew[dot]mccall[at]goraom[dot]net - we do bespoke coding,&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;and web projects in a number of languages from <a href="http://php.net/" class="zem_slink" title="PHP" rel="homepage">PHP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages" class="zem_slink" title="Active Server Pages" rel="wikipedia">ASP</a> to <a href="http://java.sun.com" class="zem_slink" title="Java (programming language)" rel="homepage">Java</a>.&nbsp;
