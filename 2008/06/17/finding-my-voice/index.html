  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Welcome to my new blog. I've tried a couple in the past and haven't managed to find my voice and get them going, but I'm going to try again. I'll basically be talking about bootstrapping our company, coding and other things I thing are interesting or relevant but I can't promise any of it will be well written, or interesting to you, though I'll try. You can help by letting me know what you think is good or more importantly what you think is bad in the comments.</p><p>The design is close to what I imagined, but I'm no designer. I can beat things into a rough shape approximation what I think would look good, but I can never get the smooth finish I'd like. As with the writing I'll work to improve this as I go.</p><h2>the conversation</h2><p>This is a conversation, the comments are as important as the posts and it's a fine line to tread. I'm not setting out to moderate the conversation in any great way; I don't have the time or inclination. I'll largely leave it alone and respect constructive criticism and comment. I won't respect attacks personal or otherwise though and will delete any and all comments which set out to disrupt the conversation</p><h2>I'm a sell out</h2><p>There are no ads on here at the moment, but one day when there are pageviews I'll probably put them on here. I reserve the right to sell out at any time - so it's probably best if you just consider me a sell out from day one. You can quote me: </p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>Andrew McCall is a sell out, he uses his blog for personal financial gain and to shamelessly plug businesses, products and other things which will either directly profit him or people he knows.</p></blockquote><p>So there you have it, my latest effort is launched - please stick around, hopefully enjoy and hit the comments to let me know how I can make it better.</p>
