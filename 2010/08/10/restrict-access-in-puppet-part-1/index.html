    <h1>Restrict access in Puppet - part 1</h1>
    <p class="meta">Aug 10, 2010</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  This time we're going to lock the server down a bit with Puppet. Now that we have our own user, let's force login using a public key we'll create for the user.

Eventually I also want to create a self signed certificate for the user to use with their public key to access resources via HTTPS with client certificates wrap the whole certificate up in a pkcs12 file and email it to them. I won't get into that yet.

I was going to write the framework myself, even had a skeleton all laid out - I'd decided on two classes, the keystore which would handle creating, storing and revoking keys and later certificates and a user class for creating users.

<ul>
<li>
<em>create &lt;user&gt;</em> creates a new user with the given username.</li>
<li>
<em>clientkey &lt;user&gt; [filename]</em> installs the key for a given user, optionally set a filename. I already have some keys</li>
<li>
<em>serverkey &lt;user&gt; [login_as]</em> installs the key into the authorized_keys allowing users to login to this server. Defaults to logging in as the same user as the key 'owner' if the. I also need to use my key to login as another user, the git and svn users for example. </li>
</ul>

Then I found the <a href="http://projects.reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Module_Ssh_Auth_Patterns">ssh::auth</a> from the puppet wiki. it's released under the GPL, while everything else I write is Apache 2 compatible - if that's a problem you may want to stop here and look for another solution. If you find one that's Apache 2 compatible, I'd love to know about it. For what I'm doing it doesn't really matter, I went with my skeleton package as a thin wrapper around it and downloaded the module into my users package.

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># wget http://projects.reductivelabs.com/attachments/download/935/auth.pp -O ./modules/user/manifests/auth.pp</pre></div>
</div>


The first thing I did was create a new keystore.pp file, the ssh::auth package made that pretty easy: 

<em><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>modules/user/manifests/keystore.pp</pre></div>
</div>
</em>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class user::keystore {
    include ssh::auth::keymaster
}</pre></div>
</div>


Then I needed to do was create a keystore. The keystore is just the host you nominate to control all your client and server keys.  To do that in nodes.pp I properly named my only node and stopped using the default and added a couple of new includes.

<em><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>manifests/nodes.pp</pre></div>
</div>
</em>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>node build {
    include sudo, user, ssh::auth, user::keystore
}</pre></div>
</div>


Run puppet and you should end up with a directory <em><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>/var/lib/keys</pre></div>
</div>
</em> ready to store keys.

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># puppet -v --modulepath=/etc/puppet/modules /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp</pre></div>
</div>


I decided I'd update my user package by removing some files and putting the user class into the init.pp file. I had too many files in there that just didn't seem to be doing anything. 

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># rm modules/user/manifests/virtual.pp
# rm modules/user/manifests/unixadmins.pp</pre></div>
</div>


Then I added a create method in the user class in my init.pp file: 

<em><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>modules/users/manifests/init.pp</pre></div>
</div>
</em>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>import &quot;*&quot;
class user {

    define create {
            @user { &quot;$title&quot;:
            ensure  =&gt; &quot;present&quot;,
            gid   =&gt; &quot;$title&quot;,
            home    =&gt; &quot;/home/$title&quot;,
            shell   =&gt; &quot;/bin/bash&quot;,
            managehome =&gt; true,
            require =&gt; [Group[&quot;$title&quot;]],
        }
        @file { &quot;/home/$title&quot;:
            ensure =&gt; &quot;directory&quot;,
            mode   =&gt; 700,
            owner  =&gt; &quot;$title&quot;,
            group  =&gt; &quot;$title&quot;,
        }
        @file { &quot;/home/$title/.ssh&quot;:
            ensure =&gt; &quot;directory&quot;,
            mode   =&gt; 600,
            owner  =&gt; &quot;$title&quot;,
            group  =&gt; &quot;$title&quot;,
        }
        @group { &quot;$title&quot;:
            ensure  =&gt; &quot;present&quot;,
        }

        realize User[$title]
        realize Group[$title]
        realize File[&quot;/home/$title&quot;]
        realize File[&quot;/home/$title/.ssh&quot;]
        ssh::auth::key{&quot;$title&quot;:}
    }
    define client_key ($ensure = &quot;&quot;, $filename = &quot;&quot;) {
        ssh::auth::client{&quot;$title&quot;: ensure=&gt;$ensure, filename=&gt;$filename}
    }
    define server_key ($ensure = &quot;&quot;, $user = &quot;&quot;) {
        ssh::auth::server{&quot;$title&quot;: ensure=&gt;$ensure, user=&gt;$user}
    }
}</pre></div>
</div>


This code defines a new method called create, and realises all the required resources, finally it generates a new key for the user. 

Now we need to update our node to create ourselves a user using this new method

<em><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>manifests/nodes.pp</pre></div>
</div>
</em>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>node my-server {
    include sudo, ssh::auth, ssh::auth::keymaster, user
    user::create{&quot;andrewmccall&quot;:}
    user::client_key{&quot;andrewmccall&quot;:}
    user::server_key{&quot;andrewmccall&quot;:}
}</pre></div>
</div>


The last step is to copy the private and public key down to a machine.

<em>It's important that you test ssh logins to this host using the new keys. Otherwise you risk locking yourself out for good!</em> 

I think that's probably a good place for me to call it a night - tomorrow I'll be locking down sshd so that only users with keys can login.
